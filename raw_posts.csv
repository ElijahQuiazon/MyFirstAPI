y7202h,3,7,okay for the first time I was asked out on a virtual date!??? should I go or advices?,"Okay so I met the person online. And she asked me on a date🤯😭. We have been casually talking but she dropped the bomb suddenly. I've never been on a date and well should I go on it? It's virtual but idk why I'm nervous lolllll.
Likeee I'm panicking causeeeee I've never been on one! Idkkkk how to act.
Guys Idk I'm not confidenttt😭😭😭 also my parents wouldn't be knowing it, would it be betraying them (cause they have done so much for me). It feels like I'm hiding something- I haven't hidden something important from them, but I just can't tell them ahhhhhh thisss is soooo scaryyyyy
For context- I have come out to my parents and am very close with them
Advices pleaseee for a panicking queer woman"

yhhksu,3,0,24[M4F] Online/Anywhere – Virtual date,"
It's been quite some time since I've been on one. If you're lonely too like me, let's make this Halloween fun and memorable? 

■ About me

I love art and enjoy sharing poetry, music, memes, I value honesty and kindness. I love to dive into funny yet meaningful and deep conversations. Moreover I  like to learn about new cultures and traditions. 

■ What do I want?

A virtual date – you and me where we watch movies, TV series or random videos on internet and talk about the characters, how they fit into our lives or differ than us, share different perspectives on the same thing. 

We can read a book as well or listen to an audiobook together and take it from there. 

On a side note, I like romance, comedy and psychological thrillers or crime related documentaries. 

■ Why go on a virtual date with me? 

1. Because you're alone as well on this Halloween and you miss having company or someone to talk to. 

2. Because it's a virtual date, you don't have to be afraid of a random stranger. I won't harm you or steal anything (except your heart).

3. You can be yourself and talk about anything without being afraid of getting judged, you don't have to pretend.

4. It will be fun and memorable, looking back at it will bring a smile to the lips and butterflies in the stomach. 

■Who am I looking for?

A flirting partner to begin with but has more to offer, someone who can understand the feelings of others and, enjoys conversations. Someone kind and honest. 

Since it's a virtual date, I hope you are comfortable with a voice call after the initial chat. 
If you are a woman who has read till here, message me with your introduction and interests. Cheers:)"
wvw21f,29,17,Virtual Date Ideas?,"Hey y'all, I was wondering if we could do a thread of virtual date ideas. My girl and I have done all the typical stuff: tv and movies, baking/cooking together, crafting together, doing face masks together, dinner dates, ect. I was wondering what other ideas you all have. What creative date ideas have you and your significant other enjoyed? Bonus points for ideas that don't require us both to leave home because my gf can't go out much due to health reasons. 

Ps. Do you have suggestions for online co-op computer or mobile games that don't require much of a graphics card? We've tried to game together but my computer isn't able to run a lot of modern games because it's not made for gaming."

w94tti,3,10,I feel sad for not getting any kind of virtual date and now I am suspected my bf,"
I (30f) is current in never met LDR with a guy from the other side of the world. He is really kind, caring and sweet. We texted the whole day (not constantly) and face time once or twice a week. We have been dating for like 2 months but during these 2 months whenever I bring up the topic about virtual dating like movie date or anything, he said 'Yes. Let's do this.' But never happened at all. One or the other thing comes up all the time. 
When we do face time, we call for like more than 2 to 3 hrs then it's not about he can't give me time at all.
Whenever I asked him directly like doesn't want anything like a virtual date, he reply like 'It's because of the time difference which is hard for him to satisfy my need.' Most of the times the reason we couldn't do dates were very serious like health or family issues (not friends related) so I couldn't be upset or even suspected him because I might have sounded immature.
I like him a lot and part of me trusts him completely. So I don't want to make things cold between us by just being immature over his serious cases (if those will true). 

Another thing is whenever we asked about our day, I am the one who tell him everyday start from end , all in detail but whenever I asked him, he just replies with Good or bad. Some people are not very talkative but later I kind of feel like he is hiding something."
xadnt0,3,1,Ideas for a virtual date with my (24F) long distance Boyfriend (26M) for our first anniversary? We’ve both been struggling a lot personally lately which has been effecting our relationship and so I want to make our anniversary special.,"We’ve known each other for about two years (introduced by a mutual friend), been dating on and off for about a year and a half, and will have been officially in a relationship for a year as of this coming Monday. We’ve met in person 3 times for a total of about 30 days together. We love each other a lot he makes me extremely happy, and though we’re different in a lot of ways I feel like those differences make us more compatible and make our relationship more interesting. But we’re also similar enough and agree on the things that are important. 

We’ve both got a lot of personal challenges, especially with mental health. He’s got some form of depression, he said he was diagnosed with dysthymia (not as bad as major depressive disorder but more long lasting) a while ago but that doesn’t quite fit and I think he needs to get reassessed, and I’m helping him to start get more serious about getting treatment for it. I’ve got treatment resistant bipolar disorder which I’ve been quite dedicated to managing for the last 10 years, but for the past year or so it’s gotten worse and I’ve spent about the past 6 months in and out of hospitals for it. 

I’m not sure if all that information matters tbh. Just basically wanted to say that our relationship has been taking some hits. He’s been distracted and spending time with friends and not really making time for me. I’ve been depressed and anytime I try to talk about our issues he takes all the blame on himself and it brings up trauma from his previous relationships so I end up trying to comfort him and we don’t actually solve anything usually. We’re still always there to help one another when in need though. Neither of us wants our relationship to end. We just need to get through this rough patch. 

TLDR: So I want to come up with a good idea for a virtual date for our anniversary. We usually just watch a marvel movie or show for our dates, but I’m hoping to come up with something more special than that. Any ideas?"

w7hy8t,1,11,He can’t commit his time to a (virtual) date. I feel butthurt :(,"26F here talking to a guy (28M) who’s thousands of miles away. We matched on an OLD app when I was in his country for vacation but haven’t met in person. Been talking for several weeks now.

We’ve expressed that we like each other and want to try being together next year (I will be moving to his country). BUT, we aren’t official and are just taking things slow and easy. All fine and dandy with me.

So I asked him out on a Netflix date, he said yes but wants to do it spontaneously due to his schedule. This kinda upsets me. We have jobs and our own lives, and we’re 6hrs apart timezone-wise, so spontaneity isn’t easy.

I know he’s not obliged to give up his time for me since we’re not officially together, but this inability to commit to a simple date is giving me doubts. 

Am I a selfish person for being upset about this? Or should I just respect his time and not make a big deal out of this?

I’d really appreciate some insights. Thank you!"

u4nd88,35,7,I got stood up for a virtual date,"So, I’ve been talking to this guy I matched with on Hinge. We’ve been texting for about 2 weeks. Set up a virtual/FaceTime call for tonight. We set it up in advance, and I even mentioned something about it last night to remind him. When he was 10 minutes late, I sent a follow up text. No response. It’s been 2 hours and I still haven’t heard from him. FML.

uf5kkk,11,9,"Failed virtual date plan, I feel empty","I scheduled to have a virtual date with my BF one week and a half prior, and it didn’t happen. BF’s never been a big fan of virtual dates but he doesn’t turn me down when I initiate having virtual dates so it was OK for a while. I’ve been planning this date for a week and cleared out my evening to accommodate for our date. BF decides to get a haircut late in the day, comes home at 3 AM for me when I expected we’d call at around 12 AM for me which is 5 PM for him. I’ve gotten ready but I refuse to have the date still when we have around 3 hours left when I’ve been planning this for a week. We also rarely ever have date nights. Last time we did was two months ago. 

I ask that we have a “consolation” video call instead and do the actual date with the activities tomorrow. He says okay but then complains that his camera doesn’t work which is okay. I suggest he use his ipad but he complains that it hits him when he uses his mouse. He eventually gives up on trying and then says “Let’s just do the date tonight, 3 hours is still 3 hours”. He also says something along the lines of that he doesn’t like the fact that it bugs him that he still has to video call the day after. He also asks what do we even do with more than 3 hours.

At this point, I’m tired, disappointed, and feel defeated. I know this virtual dates aren’t as exciting or important to him than to me but I was really looking forward to this. I’d been ready since 12 AM and had a full face of makeup and wore nice clothes. I wanted to express my frustrations and disappointments to him but I knew he’d take it as an aggression towards him so all I could do was just cry silently until I passed out. 

Now my heart’s just heavy and I don’t know what to do. He’s a physical touch and acts pf service love language type of person so I’m trying hard to understand him but mine is quality time and right now all I feel is that he doesn’t value my time at all."

He told me he is ""very aware"" and pro people opting for therapy. But then he quickly jumped to how there needs to be an exit strategy for people opting for therapy.😅 

He spoke about how he had sleepless nights cause his ex preferred listening to music to calm herself to sleep . I told him that it could be her sleep hygiene and her non negotiable while he insisted that it is a form of addiction and how therapy in general can be a form of addiction. He moved it to how people smoke and that calms them but that is addiction too. 

According to him, once you are aware of your problem, you can recover from it by yourself, you don't need therapy then. 😶 And of course he knows all of this cause he has done a show and hence had to conduct "" research"" on it. (I mean who needs psychology degree and counselling certification and years of experience?)

I tried to tell him that therapy cannot have an exit strategy besides getting better as it really depends on how deep rooted your issues are. Of course this did not sit well with him and he made it all about how i threw i am a feminist in his face🙃 he went on to say he doesn't understand why feminists have to be in your face all the time when he is a ""feminist"" as he was brought up by a strong woman but he doesn't go around saying it and neither does his mom. 😶 (All I had said was that i had studied a paper in feminism as part of my literature degree🤦‍♀️)"

I had a first virtual date with someone today and I thought it went well. At the end, he said it was nice and we should do it again, and to let him know when I’m free next. I was the one who said I had to go after talking for 1.5 hours (I actually had to go and had mentioned this beforehand via text, so it wasn’t an excuse to leave). It’s been a few hours now and I haven’t heard from him. Should I be the one reaching out to him to let him know when I’m free, or should I wait for him to reach out?

Thanks!"

In person dates def take more planning and time, so just for the sake of saving time and energy, I like virtual first.

pa9i4a,5,17,Gauging chemistry on virtual date,"Hi there! Originally posted this to the rant/rave discussion, but wanted to make it a proper post and throw out some questions for the fellas (but I welcome anyone to comment):

How important is chemistry for you on a first date? And how do you gauge that on a virtual date where a lot of the intangibles (like how someone smells, for example) don't come into play?

I (F) had a video date with someone and immediately afterward, he sent me a message saying we didn’t have chemistry. I appreciated the follow-up, but honestly I was bummed and even taken aback by how quickly he sent the message. It made me wonder, “What did I do wrong?”

I could feel that the conversation was a bit awkward (some silence) at times, but that’s not a “chemistry killer” for me. I would have gladly met up in person to truly feel things out before calling it. My date was attractive, I was interested in knowing more about him, and some awkward pauses (\*especially\* on video chat) don’t really phase me. But the feeling wasn’t mutual, so I’m just curious what types of things guys are gauging on a first virtual date? Will some awkward pauses immediately kill your interest?

In general, the older I get, the less important “chemistry” on a first date becomes. That all-consuming “here come the fireworks” feeling hasn’t served me well in the past. So on a first date, I’m basically gauging if we have similar values (which you can’t know all up front anyway), if I’m curious to know more about someone, and if there’s a certain level of attraction. As long as someone isn’t disrespectful or inconsiderate, I’m open to seeing them again because first dates can be hard for anyone and a little awkward isn’t bad...

EDIT: Thanks for the comments! Common response seems to be that ""no chemistry"" is just a blanket term for any number of reasons why someone isn't interested in moving things forward. And as far as virtual dates, they can help some people get a vibe for their date and for others, they aren't the place to gauge chemistry. "

qwk63b,492,31,Teyvat's Cute Virtual Dating Spots Guide! (ft. Childe lol),"# Warning Long Post!

This post is mostly aimed at those couples who can’t see each other for a while due to Covid or those who are in a long-distance relationship (can also apply to people who like to roleplay too!) who also play Genshin. For most e-dates, I recommend picking out something to do IRL (such as eating dinner or drinking tea) while hanging out in these places in Genshin. It kinda helps you feel less distant from one another. I was also kinda curious if there were any cute places you can even go on a virtual e-date in Genshin, so I took it upon myself to run around and look for as many places as I can find. Below you’ll find both well-known and not-so-well-known places that I think are fit for a cute e-date. If I’ve missed any places or you have a cute spot of your own let me know in the comments! (This is also my first long guide so go easy on me if you see mistakes! >\_<)

# Mondstat

**Starsnatch Cliff**

This place has a fantastic view of Mondstat and is lore-wise the perfect date spot for many locals there. Sadly there is no place to sit down so you’ll have to stand around or maybe recreate the iconic scene from Titanic at the peak of the cliff if you’d like. I recommend going in the daytime right before sundown for a private sunset experience (plus at night you’d have to deal with another couple sitting there with you). 

[Sunset](https://preview.redd.it/ncmminc3ta081.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=94769bf6c9c1702aa49bcc8286073ad5c9b69471)

**Cat’s Tail and Good Hunter (Outdoor Seating)**

A good first or second date spot. Nothing too fancy but not too casual either. These spots can make great chill and hang-out locations too. The bustling noises of Mondstat also add to create a bit of a “city vibe”. There isn’t anything else particularly to note. The main downside of these places is that there aren't any good views and can be a bit boring.

[Cat's Tail](https://preview.redd.it/r0amp4xrta081.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0203d1bf31d52039eeaac986f73db36e48fc2d1)

**Angel’s Share**

Really great first-date spot. Plenty of seating and has a cozy tavern atmosphere, including the soundtrack. You can buy drinks from Christopher then go sit down and have a chat. There are two floors in the building. The bottom floor has a livelier feeling with people hanging around, drinking, and having conversations. The upstairs is more private for those who’d like some more privacy.

[Upstairs](https://preview.redd.it/fd36zr5kua081.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=9cd3be5f54bee6cab14557f9be188b531c3f1e13)

# Liyue

**Mt. Aocang**

The view and soundtrack here are fantastic, a perfect place for Zhongli fans. As someone who really enjoys the vibe and atmosphere of Liyue, this spot is one of my favorites to have conversations and tea at. You can sit at the table in the middle island. I recommend going in the middle of the day or near sunset. Unfortunately, you can’t see the sunset from the table but if you move to the stove at the West side of the area there’s a cute sunset viewing area with a good view.

[During the day at the table!](https://preview.redd.it/6q10rzn7va081.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=3741494aa6f0a707582b12641c2e47d17f7b2529)

[Sunset spot!](https://preview.redd.it/8uq9tw6ava081.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=f306dcf549042f897e9f0bb5a49d05b45e1ada76)

**Adepti Floating Abode** 

A nice nighttime date spot. I recommend coming here near sunset and throughout the night. The soundtrack and atmosphere are extremely mellow which makes for a good chat and stargazing spot. If you pay attention to the night sky you might be able to catch sight of a galaxy and a clear view of Celestia. Did I mention there’s also seating here!

[Nighttime](https://preview.redd.it/7dsxwlolva081.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e1cca19bab4d652fb0ba275d047005cb0915730)

**Xinyue Kiosk** 

This is like Genshin’s equivalent of a “fancy restaurant”. You can come here if you feel a bit fancy and wanna sit somewhere that feels fancy. A big perk is you get the entire place to yourself unlike the Luili Pavilion (there’s a Fontaine merchant there). A negative is there isn’t anything too special about the place and staying there can get a bit boring.

[During the Afternoon](https://preview.redd.it/etlp6g81wa081.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2c7493b4e8c92c26f2fa26247bc66fa1bd113a4)

**Yansheng Teahouse**

At the top of the building near the sign is a seating area that’s out of the way in a private little corner. Like the Cat’s Tail and Good Hunter in Mondstat, this area has a bustling city vibe to it where you can enjoy a city atmosphere. You can get a little bit of a seafront view from here too. The only major downside is having to listen to the repeating dialogue of the rude a-hole that works downstairs (and the idea that the place you’re having a date at may or may not be a brothel). I highly recommend coming here during the daytime.

[During the Day](https://preview.redd.it/hizqunrbwa081.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bcbe7e62e5b5e2c03ff49944228fdf3718069d1)

**The Pearl Galley**

Another one of those “fancy restaurant” style places. This place is Genshin’s equivalent of a “dinner and a show” type place. During the night, the lights on the boat light up making it super cute and atmospheric. Plus there is always one free table there for you and your date! The only big downside here is that the boat itself is a bit inaccessible and hard to get to. I recommend using a cryo character like Kaeya or Kokomi burst to get there.

[During the Night](https://preview.redd.it/5v4pbeqlwa081.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=92e65b69a674607b5aeaf72467248ee447bdd89c)

**Cliff North of Liyue Harbor**

Like Starsnatch Cliff in Mondstat, this place has a great overall view, especially at night. Sadly there is also no place to sit down. You can come here and watch the sunset right over Liyue Harbor along with watching the city light up at night!

[Liyue at Night](https://preview.redd.it/itp4j47uwa081.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=30b36bc6817dbe29ba8a589649bb3987d18dc079)

# Inazuma

**Uyuu Resturant**

A cute ramen place located right at the heart of Inazuma City! Definitely one of my favorite cute dating spots. Apparently, not a lot of people know about this place so it can be a neat little gem or surprise for your partner. There are two floors, with the first floor being a ramen bar and the upstairs being a private dining area (sadly you can’t sit upstairs though). 

[Ramen Bar!](https://preview.redd.it/90kt3ko6xa081.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ba43e3a1eae8fbb69c8e2d197e6a09dde1bd3c7)

**Komore Teahouse**

A more fancy option in Inazuma. There is a private room you can use that allows you to sit at a table for some hot pot. The atmosphere and soundtrack here are extremely calm too. Like other places such as Xinyue Kiosk, it can get a little boring sitting here for a while, but at least you get the added bonus of Taroumaru here.

[Private Seating Spot](https://preview.redd.it/2grg2y0hxa081.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=cfa3054d8d42b2fdd7318d0792060abf68a26d6e)

[Taroumaru](https://preview.redd.it/85uuueyixa081.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7e2c25858a60ac2b3a368803773533641769db9)

**Streets of Ritou and Amakane Island**

These are more for those who like to go shopping as a date. I definitely recommend going during the afternoon for Ritou and night for Akamane for a cuter atmospheric vibe. These two places can also make a great post-dinner date spot to just walk around and talk about whatever is on your mind with your partner! I also need to mention there are cricket or cicada noises at night on Akamane that I find really nice that adds to the atmosphere there.

[Amakane Island Sitting Spot](https://preview.redd.it/i3c0hpftxa081.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac4fe436d1390a3a270cfa7f092d561e7079f4f2)

**Chinju Forest**

Perfect date spot for people who like late-night, nature-y dates. Also fantastic for Ayaka fans. It's perpetually nighttime in this area so you don’t have to worry about resetting the clock constantly or picking a time of day to go. The glowing flowers make the place look absolutely stunning. I believe this spot gives off the most romantic atmosphere when compared to all the other places.

[Chinju Forest](https://preview.redd.it/074z6tq0ya081.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=a984c895e49f71a11899a7139d127c7c6c99722c)

# Honorable Mentions

**Windrise**

I don’t particularly like this spot since there isn’t anything too interesting here. It’s just a big magical tree. If you are a fan of Noelle then this is a good spot for you. There isn’t anywhere to sit and doesn’t have a particularly great view of anything. The only thing I can recommend is maybe climbing and standing on the tree maybe? It would make a great picnic spot if we can set out a picnic set though.

[Windrise during the Day](https://preview.redd.it/20m9lbaaya081.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=db3429e8d2b9975175f5b854627a2c6756dee190)

**Dawn Winery**

Unless you are into hijacking someone’s mansion for a date or a Diluc fan, can’t really recommend Dawn Winery but it’s there as an option. The atmosphere is rather cute and you do get to chill out at a Winery and pretend to go wine tasting.

[Perfect for a Diluc Date](https://preview.redd.it/fo1wthwhya081.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ae14448a32124834d94b67e20ab76fe2f356199)

**Asase Shrine**

Just a cute cat shrine, with a ton of cats. A good fit for people who really love cats! Not much else can be said, just, catssssssss. Not to mention there’s a talking cat here! Ehe\~

[KITTYSSSSS](https://preview.redd.it/02x2touqya081.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=9df96058ef28cb93773f2487464cceaa7df1e8c3)

**Serenitea Pot**

I know there are you Teapot mains out there with the world’s most gorgeous teapots. If you have the talent, I definitely recommend making a date spot with your teapot prowess. This is definitely much more personal for you and your partner because you customize the spot for the occasion!

[My Personal Fave Serenitea Pot Spot](https://preview.redd.it/ghrtxa30za081.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8f4f48d60537a403220b69971772c170f9ce2eb)

# For those with questionable taste...

**Mondstat Cathedral (Outdoors and Indoors)**

Woah there bucko? Are we already getting married here? I’m only going over dating spots, but the cathedral is a great place to get married (I sure hope you don’t actually have a real ceremony here). Jokes aside, inside the cathedral is a cute place to reenact getting married. Outside I don’t really recommend it since you’ll be sitting several yards away from a cemetery and I don’t know about you but, I wouldn’t appreciate going on a date at a cemetery, but you do you. At least there’s plenty of seating and I recommend going here at night I guess?

[Seating Spot Several Yards Away from a Cemetary](https://preview.redd.it/9h2inxheza081.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=911f816b05a0190e63f2b6d0efc72569b63dbfaf)"
p5w6r1,3,21,"I felt like I got ""stood up"" on a "" virtual date"" or did I overreact?","So I've been talking to this guy on a dating app for a few days. He seem handsome and nice and we talked a lot. 

A couple days ago he asked if we could facetime for the first time and I said yes and arranged for us to do it tonight when I was free. 

I like doing facetime before face to face interactions too when it comes to online dating.

Anyways I was really excited and planned my evening so I can be free to talk to him. I even got my hair cute for it.

Anyways its started getting late and he usually sleeps by 9:30 so I texted him an hour early to ask when hes available to start the facetime.

But he texted me that he totally forgot about it and that he was at bar with a few friends.

But then he asked if I was free much later that night or tomorrow.

I got so disappointed and felt stupid so I told him ""don't worry about, maybe some other time"" and then ""I'm not sure about tomorrow"".

I just got the vibe that I made him more of a priority than he did me.

He hasn't responded after what I told him.

Did I overreact?"
qmdeqd,4,5,Well I just had my first virtual date,"We spoke through video chat and I didn't answer at first because I about had a panic attack.

Then we spoke on the second call. I flopped pretty hard 😂. I didn't know what to say and unfortunately the topic of careers and what I want to do in life came up. I really don't know what I want to do but that's such a turn off answer. People like people with confidence that know what they want. It kinda went down hill from there. We made plans to meet this Friday but they cancelled them because they'll be busy with work which is keyword for I'm not interesting enough to meet in person.

At least I can say I finally did it. But I definitely need professional help going forward if I ever want to meet someone in person. I kinda feel like garbage now. I really hate that I'm so socially inept. I feel so worthless. I wasted a month and a half talking to this person for them to lose interest in a 20 minute video call.

She declined (as I expected), but she thought it was a really sweet gesture.

Our date was less awkward than expected. We did it through Bumble’s video chat feature. There were a ton of technical difficulties throughout the call so that was a hinderance. But I think our chemistry prevailed and we were pretty comfortable by the end of the date. It’s a shame, I think if we had met in person we would’ve had a really great conversation.

We agreed to meet in person, as long as there isn’t a big COVID-spike in our state in the next week. *fingerscrossed*

2. If you can't go out then you can use Google Earth - anyone of you can stream their screen and you can visit any place you want.

mt5vdv,5,12,When FaceTiming a match should I be wearing makeup even if it’s not a virtual “date”?,"I’m new to dating and online dating. I talked to a match a few times and the third time he asked if we could FaceTime. I finally gained the courage to say yes and when we did he asked to see my hair (since I usually have it up and it was up in all my photos) and basically said I would look better if I had makeup on (I filled in my brows/put under eye concealer, but that’s was all). I ended up politely telling this person that I was no longer interested since those comments and the way they chose to deliver them bothered me/hurt my feelings.

 I talked about it with my therapist and she said, that while the delivery of the message was bad, I should take some sort of note from this encounter/how it’s important to put your best foot forward,etc.

So I’m supposed to talk on the phone with another match tomorrow. I don’t know if they are going to ask to FaceTime, but I feel like I should put some effort (changing up my hair, some natural makeup) just in case. 

Do other people do this? I guess to both guys and girls if there is a possibility of FaceTiming do you put a little bit more of effort in your appearance even though it’s not a date/is a first meeting? Is there an expectation for this usually?"

ko7bia,14,15,AITA for getting upset my boyfriend left our virtual date to hang out with his friends?,"My boyfriend and I have been together for two years January 2021. My boyfriend has a good group of friends that he sees weekly. Mostly on Fridays, but other days as his work schedule permits. I’ve accepted that and I know that Fridays are his days with his friends.

We haven’t been able to see each other since end of October, so we try to watch TV shows together as a way of having little date nights. He’s been busy this week - so I have been waiting for some quality time together.

Today, New Years Eve, we FaceTimed at midnight, and we decided to start a new show together. 10 minutes in, he says he needs to pause. 5 minutes into the pause, he tells me his friends called, they want to get dessert and he has to cut our date short. Ok. Fine.

5 minutes after that, he calls back and says his friends are going to be late - so we can continue watching. I initially said yes, and shortly after messaged and said I didn’t want to continue watching right now. I told him I was upset he blew off our date so easily - then called me back because his friends were late and wanted me to continue on like nothing happened and I didn’t think that was fair. 

He apologized and said he understood, but thinks if the situation was reversed, he wouldn’t be upset.

He’s out right now and I can’t tell if I’m just being dramatic. So I just want to know - am I the asshole for being upset?"

Let’s keep it real - we’re all rocking sweatpants and not our best hair styles right now. So getting all done up seems unnecessary.

But I’m worried I won’t look anything like my profile pics and the guy might think I catfished him or something. I have rosacea, and look like a pink mess without makeup on.

Opinions?? I’ll be sure to update you guys with news on how it went!!

**Update**
He catfished me! And thanks to a virtual date, I found out earlier rather than later!!

I made the effort to put on normal makeup, curl just the front sections of my hair, and put on a cute sweater, and he looked nothing like his pics (that were taken at least over a year and fifty pounds ago).

I need to virtual date more often to weed out the catfishers. A person looks so much different on camera than in pics."

A couple days ago he asked if we could facetime for the first time and I said yes and arranged for us to do it tonight when I was free. 

I like doing facetime before face to face interactions too when it comes to online dating.

Anyways I was really excited and planned my evening so I can be free to talk to him. I even got my hair cute for it.

Anyways its started getting late and he usually sleeps by 9:30 so I texted him an hour early to ask when hes available to start the facetime.

But he texted me that he totally forgot about it and that he was at bar with a few friends.

But then he asked if I was free much later that night or tomorrow

I got so disappointed and felt stupid so I told him ""don't worry about, maybe some other time"" and then ""I'm not sure about tomorrow"".

I just got the vibe that I made him more of a priority than he did me.

iud9n6,9,28,Did I overreact to a guy who forgot about a virtual date?,"I am in my early 30s and gay. Although the dynamics in gay world can be different, I don’t think my sexuality requires a totally different viewpoint and perspective in this story. 

I met a guy on Tinder and we started chatting for about a week or so. He’s a bit older than me and seems to have a good job in his field. We talked about our jobs, background, and so on, and basically just basic information about ourselves. He suggested a phone or a video call to get to know each other. The actual words were he was not “opposed” to having a call if I was down to that. I responded that I preferred to meet in person because I am so awkward on the phone, but he was concerned about the pandemic situation and said that if we hit it off, we could meet in person. Well, I guess I had to adapt to our challenging environment these days and agreed to do so. 

He suggested that we have a call on Tuesday. It was actually very abrupt because he was going on a lunch break in 15 minutes and asked if I was available. I wasn’t and in fact, he got caught up with phone calls in the end and was not available. He apologized and suggested that night instead, but I was not available, so I said I would be available next day (Wednesday) evening, so we decided to have a call on Wednesday. On Tuesday night, I briefly mentioned that I survived New York during the quarantine, and this intrigued him and he said “we have something to talk about tomorrow”. Flash forward to Wednesday morning, he said “haha” in response to something I said, my very last message, sent on Tuesday night. However, we did not decide on the specific time. The whole day passed by quickly because I was busy with work and now around 9:30, he still didn’t call me. I take partial responsibility of not confirming the time with him, but also, it was his idea to have a call, so I guess I was expecting him to call me. Based on the past conversation with him, his messages were sporadic and seemed to be the kind of communicator who says what he wants to say and puts his phone away. We didn’t really have a back and forth continuous text conversation. I sensed that he would not call me so I sent him a message saying, “Well, I guess this call is not happening”. 

Around 10:30, he sent me the following message: “sorry, I got home recently after having had dinner with friends outside, and I got to reading and forgot about this. I’m not very diligent with dating stuff. Perhaps I’m a bit discouraged (or disgusted?) by the world of dating. But it’s no reason to be rude to you. I’m sorry if you expected a call tonight. anywho, have a good night, and let’s try some other time if you want.”

I didn’t respond right away because there was a lot to unpack from here. There are just so many red flags for me. First of all, I hate my time being wasted, but I am not an unreasonable person. If he was sick or had a family emergency, I would have understood. I did make myself available that night when I could have done something more productive. Despite his honesty, just forgetting was not a rational excuse to me and he did recognize that he was rude. But most of all, do I want to spend time on someone who is not even serious about dating? And trust me, I fully understand the sentiment of being tired of this dating world. In the end, my answer was no. I sent him this message: 

“Pass. I don’t think it’s necessary to reply but I will. I firmly believe that manners make the man. It was your idea to have a call which I agreed. If as little as setting up a call cannot happen, I don’t see any prospects, especially after chatting yesterday about the call today. Although you don’t owe me anything, it already says a lot about your interest level, mindset, and capacity. I don’t enjoy this exhausting dating game either, but I haven’t lost my manners. I am looking for someone who is seriously looking and it’s good to know in advance that you are not serious although it’s disappointing.”

Then he said “I respect your decision, but I find your tone unnecessarily mean.”

Was I really mean? I feel a bit petty to reply in this manner, but if he was not even going to put in this little effort in meeting someone, I think I dodged a bullet. Any thoughts?"

gxzvtq,25,25,AITA for cancelling a virtual date with my bf after he was insensitive?,"

This happened during a text conversation regarding events across the pond. So I’ve been through the justice system and as a victim and it was the worst experience of life. He’s seen my go through this, and how badly it still effects me (was only a year ago). I mentioned via text how bad the justice system is. His response was that our justice system is one of the better ones. He knows fully well what I’ve gone through. So I went a bit over the top messaging him with why I think our system is so flawed and how others are better. He replied “why have you lost the plot?”. I explained he was insensitive as he had praised a system caused me to develop PTSD (which I still have). He usually researchers  everything before coming to an opinion, but he hasn’t ever bothered to look to look into something which caused me more pain than the abuse itself. So his opinion seems unjustified, and that my most profound experience isn’t worth looking into further. He said he didn’t think he’d said anything wrong. So I told him not bother with our plans online tonight.

I’m often over the top and get upset for issues, which are my problem. However, this is something he knows I’m really affected by. I don’t think he meant to hurt me not at all. I just think he was insensitive as he knows what I’ve been through. I felt too mad to have a Skype date so I cancelled, and this is the first time anything like this has happened between us. We still haven’t spoken to each other since I cancelled. Should I wait for him to message me or am I the ass hole?"

iomfxw,6,14,When to reach back out after this post virtual date situation?,"Hey Everyone!

So I (27M) connected with (28F) on a dating app a week and a half ago and we hit it off.  7 days straight of enthusiastic texting followed by a 2.5hr virtual date.  

On Friday, she left our city to go across the country for a 1 month planned trip to spend with her BFF, in a “I’ve been waiting for this trip for so long and nothing else matters” vibe, which of course is totally understandable.

We knew this going into the virtual date and after it was over, made it clear that I had a great time, would love to stay in touch, and maybe do something together (social distancing observed) when she gets back.  She reciprocated on all factors and regarding staying in touch, nothing personal, stated that she might not respond due to her trip.  I of course totally understood and agreed.  

I texted her Friday morning wishing her all he best on the trip and have pretty much kept it at that.

From this point, I am wondering if there is anything I can do in the long run to maintain and keep the “momentum” going? Thinking about sending a check-in text in 2 weeks along the lines of “hope the trip is a blast, etc”.

For both guys and girls that have been in her situation, what is the realistic expectation here?  Especially with all of the conversation we’ve had so far?  Is there an appropriate time to reach out?  Totally get it if there isn’t as well.

Thanks in advance!"

Context: X is from South Africa,  and wants to get to know (with the main purpose of getting into a relationship with Y) Y. Y is from the USA and has never met X before. X wants to use Snapchat as a way to talk to Y and get to know her. Hopefully befriending her and then wanting to get into a relationship with her.

I got out of a long term relationship late last year. After the last relationship ended, he asked me if there's anything happening around my dating space. I said I wanted to stay single for at least till the pandemic is over since I haven't been single for a few years. 

Currently we are pretty far away (different countries). We hang out virtually to watch a movie and chat every few weeks or just message a few times a week, although the frequency has been slowly increasing. I feel like I'm really developing feelings for this guy, and not sure what to do with it. He's becoming a close friend and I treasure the friendship. 

I'm debating whether to tell him I have feelings for him. I could also wait until September, where there's a 75% chance I'll be in the same city as him so things won't be virtual. It's really hard to tell if he's completely platonic with me, and if I should ask him out right now."

I'm in a new relationship (one month) and are currently virtual/long distance due to the pandemic. We decided for our next date we'd like to do a game night. I really want to make sure she has a lot of fun and has the best time ever so I'm trying to find some awesome two-player games we could play together over Zoom. Are there any great  fun two-player games?

&#x200B;

While I'm open to all suggestions. Some notes:

* Could be on browser, some application or mobile. If it's on mobile we're on Android and Apple so it would have to be available on both devices.
* Free is obviously awesome but I don't mind paying. Preferably if it's only one person that needs to buy the game that would be ideal; I don't want he paying but I know if it requires both people to pay, since we're long-distance it would be harder to pay for her (she wouldn't accept)
* In terms of playstyle, again open to any suggestions but the simpler the rules the better. I hope to keep it light and easy; neither of us are ""gamers"".
* Apparently she is competitive when it comes to board games so a competitive game that gets her excited might keep her engaged and having fun?
* If it's an application - the easier the application is to learn/use/control the better

Anyways, thank you so much for any suggestions! I just want this to be an awesome night. Normally we've done just ""talking"" dates over webcam which has been beyond amazing so I only want the game-night to enhance the night, so want to make sure I pick a good game."

My fiancée is stuck in Japan because of COVID, and I have lots of free time because [government bureaucracy](https://old.reddit.com/r/belgium/comments/il8lkm/im_not_from_the_eu_i_recently_got_laid_off_due_to/). I finally found a new job, so I'm going tourism again, and I'm looking for nice date ideas that we can do.

Basically, I drive somewhere nice, and we call while I have a walk, with good sights and interesting things to see. A couple of weeks ago, I went to the Japanse Tuin in Hasselt, and the arboreum in Bokrijk. Today, I'll be going to Dinant (walk from the station to the citadel for nice views), then maybe drop by La Chandelle on the way to (definitely) Vêves Castle.

After that would probably be me on my own. I'd like to see Park Furfooz. Might do the park before the castle because I don't think I'll have signal in the castle. That would show her the outside.

If I don't feel tired after or if I still have a lot of time, I'd like to drop by Givet in France (without getting out of the car; just to say I drove in another country), on the way to Castle of Freÿr on the way back to Brussels. That being said, my longest drive until now has been 2 hours, and this would make today 4 hours long instead of 3, so I think I'll probably skip these.)

Next time, I might take her for a walk around Brugge or Gent for the classic Belgian experience (we managed to visit Antwerp (physically) before the lockdown), but I'd love to hear your opinions. Where do you think would be good places to go?

We both like nature, old things (e.g., fossils and architecture), and castles. (She hates bugs, but she'll be inside my phone for the next few months, so that doesn't matter right now.) In terms of safety, I'm looking for something that can be reached by car relatively easily, and something that has beautiful views that would even look good during a video call (assuming a good signal). I'll obviously be avoiding interacting with humans, as well as most indoor spaces.

Thanks!"
