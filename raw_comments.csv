t3_y7202h,4,"Keep that panic and be a studdering mess at the date. Might go bad but would also be Hella cute.

What helps me a lot is dress up. But hiding behind a pile of blankets might work as well."
t3_y7202h,3,Do it! Better to see if you are compatible online than in person
t3_y7202h,4,"Oh honey it absolutely isn’t “betraying” anyone, including your parents, to go on a date w/o telling them!!

You sound super stressed! Take a few minutes to breathe and ground yourself, you’re gonna be just fine :) Go on that date and be yourself: your nervous, giddy, excited self and you’ll both have a great time 💖💖"

t3_wvw21f,10,Dovey!!! Was such a bless in my ldr
t3_wvw21f,7,boardgameareana.com has been a life saver for me and my bf on date nights! there's tons of games that you 2 can play together for free or you can pay a subscription fee to play some of their more popular games
t3_wvw21f,7,Me n my boyfriend play ludo King together why don't u try that and following to see ideas lol
t3_wvw21f,7,"Videogames have been key for my bf and I. Minecraft, LoL, Raft. We even play Sims simultaneously even tho it's not online, and it still makes us feel close together."
t3_wvw21f,3,"my bf and I love doing the wordle, heardle, quordle (then tons of practice quordles) together 🥰🥰🥰"
t3_wvw21f,2,"Games - mobile work well like Trivia Crack, or racing games"
t3_wvw21f,2,"Stardew Valley is pretty nice and chill. If you want something more challenging, there's Terraria. They're both games that do not require very capable computers to run."
t3_wvw21f,2,Gonna throw it out there that Stardew Valley is an awesome co-op game!
t3_wvw21f,1,"Oh man, I'm just starting to go down the road of online coop games too.  Here's what's off the top of my head on the steam client:

We are here series (one of em is free!)
Broforce
Trine series
Earth defense series
Monster hunter 
Dark souls 
Lovers in a dangerous spacetime
Splinter cell conviction (connecting for a multiplayer game is messed up, read up on it before doing it)
Brothers a tale of 2 sons
A way out
Enter the gungeon?

Some of em are running on the higher end but definitely at least a few of em that you can run"

t3_w94tti,3,Your feelings are valid and if he constantly refuses a virtual date chances are he might be hiding something!
t3_w94tti,3,"He may not tell you a whole lot about his day because be could be emotionally unavailable? Some guys have a hard time opening up, and it’s not on purpose."
t3_w94tti,2,"So what are you doing for 3 hours then???

And why don't you count that as a date too? 🤔"
t3_xadnt0,2,"One of my favorite ideas is cooking together and having the ""same"" meal. Sure thing it takes some privacy for being in the kitchen with the video call on, and a little skill so you don't burn the house down 🤪 but is rewarding as heck. And, of course, it all depends on budget: you could send him food like some UberEATS or such, a care pack, handwritten letter, matching keychains/necklaces/rings... But, if it's possible, I'd stick with the cooking and eating together! 🥰"
t3_wdprxm,27,"If by virtual date you mean you’re gonna go out to dinner and FaceTime the whole time…don’t. It’s weird and rude to other people dining around you. People always think they’re more quiet than they actually are on phone calls.

Buy yourself some ice cream or a to go cocktail and go find a nice bench on the Hudson River greenway or Brooklyn Bridge Park instead"
t3_vz4ag6,3,I saw a post like this recommending Dovey dates. We had tried one out and it was a neat experience!
t3_vz4ag6,2,"You guys could put your cams on and sing together (if your comfortable) or cook something together, go on google maps and explore eachothers cities/countries, go for a walk together and send snaps/pics of the night sky or just talk on the phone (cheesy i know). You could have a little drawing competition where you both draw eachother just for the laughs. Discuss future, when your going to meet up (if your at that stage obv)."
t3_vz4ag6,2,"Take a walk together!

Other ideas I have but have not tried yet…

Cooking the same dish together, showing each other it, and then eating it together might be fun

t3_uf5kkk,7,"I think that there are two issues here: one is that he's handled the situation badly and been a bit disrespectful of your time and effort, but the other is that you have different expectations of quality time and haven't found a compromise on it.

It wasn't fair for him to agree to it and then avoid the issue, fail to show up on time and quibble about the details. And of course the time difference means that it's awkward and requires forward planning that you *both* need to honour and engage in.

Having said that, though...  if I've read this right you were hoping for a six-hour date and honestly, as much as I love spending time with Bloke, I'd struggle with that - he's a lot less talky than me and would absolutely hate it. We're both quite active and busy with a lot to do, and it's a huge chunk of the day to spend in the house and tied to a device. Even if we cook or watch a film together it only really kills a few hours, and neither of us are up for being totally engaged and sociable for that length of time.

I'm not saying this to invalidate your wants - which of course you're perfectly entitled to -  more to make you aware that there are a lot of reasons why he might not have particularly wanted to do it that have nothing to do with his feelings or level of respect for you. And also that I suspect it's something that a lot of people would have to find a compromise on.

I would suggest sitting down and working out exactly what you wanted to get out of the experience and where you're prepared to compromise on it (two three-hour dates where you do some stuff might be an easier commitment for him to make, for example). Then sit down and have a conversation with him to work out if and where you can find a middle-ground that suits you both, and to establish some ground-rules and boundaries about how you approach it when you disagree about something."
t3_uf5kkk,2,"I would say that maybe instead of virtual dates you need to find things which will be interesting for you both? Clearly he doesn't like the idea of being on the video call at all. So why be pushy? 

So maybe switch around a few things? If you want to dress up and get full face of makeup, you can use it for something else, like made a video for him or a tease."
t3_vloom6,18,"1. Ordering the same food (ex: you both order McDonald's) and eating it together as if you were on an in-person date 

2. Study dates- Since you're both full time students, you guys can study while on videochat

3. Finding a multiplayer game and play it together 

4. Getting each other gifts and opening them on camera (You can also make it a challenge like you can only spend up to $25 on the other person) 

5. Getting dressed like you're going to a fancy restaurant 

6. Like number #5, have themed virtual dates like pajama party, wearing the same color, etc. 

7. Working out together"

t3_vloom6,4,"Dinner dates, arts and crafts, virtual museum tours, virtual zoos, q and a session about deeper stuff or stuff you are curious about, movies, video games (if you are into it) there are many different things you can do irl as a date to do an online version."
t3_vloom6,3,"Dinner with facetime. Movies with live chat. Walking outside. Going to park - also on facetime. 
Reading together. Studying together. These are what we do"
t3_vloom6,1,"With respect to watching movies, me and my gf watch shows and movies all the time, so I hope this can help. 

If you guys both have Netflix there's an extension on Google chrome, Netflix party, which allows you to both watch something at the same time with your Netflix. We're usually on discord with video on while we do this. 

If you don't have Netflix and one person is streaming from a browser, use Firefox. The screen won't be blank (again we use discord for this). Soap2day usually has good streams for shows and movies.

Hope this helps.

Also, dressing up and having dinner/watching a show is always really fun.

Playing games if you guys are into that as well is so good. I recommend ""It Takes Two"" on steam. A bit pricey (only one of you have to buy it tho), but a truly amazing co-op game. 100% worth it if you guys like playing games."
t3_vloom6,1,"My boyfriend and I were watching movies together. We are almost 10,000km apart. Time zone difference of 6 hours. 

I suggest using teleparty. Netflix supports this. Both of you need to download this extension on Google chrome (it must be on Google chrome). You can have your WhatsApp video or FaceTime on your phone switched on, watch your movies on the laptop together."
t3_to16mq,5,"That sounds really great! 

We have ours on Saturdays 😊 it's been really nice. We have the same cuisine and eat together on video call and then have special quality time, though sometimes it's spent the same way as any other night. Gaming together, occasionally TV or a movie. But always very sweet and focused on us. Do you two get dressed up for the date as well?"
t3_to16mq,2,what games? curious!
t3_to16mq,2,"My bf and I do the same thing too! Glad we're not the only ones.

t3_r5ujxj,4,It can be fun if you’re playing a game/watching something at the same time as them. If you’re just video chatting it adds nothing but stress compared to a normal phone call
t3_r5ujxj,3,"so, I hate everything virtual with a passion. like, I'd rather not do something than do it virtually.

My now-girlfriend and I had planned a 3rd date when my daughter was exposed to COVID. We had discussed it and decided to just have a date like a week or so later instead.

I really liked her and decided to just try to do a virtual date. I suggested we bake cookies over FaceTime (she loves baking) and honestly, she mentioned recently that even though she was super skeptical of the idea, that date is what sold her on me after the fact."
t3_r5ujxj,2,"Calling it a date makes it weird. Plenty of people videocall before meeting, ive been doing so for years, there's nothing weird about it."
t3_r5ujxj,1,"> I'm getting a bit impatient

That is fine if you are in a position to be picky, be selective of your matches.

>But is it okay to do it after only a few messages/ couple of days of messaging ?

Depends on number of messages, depth, chemistry not character count, timers etc."
t3_r5ujxj,1,"""But is it okay to do it after only a few messages/ couple of days of messaging ?""

it may not be ok with every girl you talk to, but it only has to be ok with that one girl. Ive never done a video chat . its not something that interests me. you dont need to ask our opinion for what works for you and that potential special one. 

if it helps you cope with anxiety from the beginning, then go for it. dont forget the other side has the same anxiety as you most of the time."
t3_r5ujxj,1,"It seems like most of the replies here are from men so far. I’m a woman & personally I love the idea of virtual dates. I’d say just make sure to have some kind of “activity” planned as a couple of other said. Whether it’s videoing while baking or having dinner or streaming a movie, just make sure you have something set up to make it feel less like an interview. 

As far as how soon, it’s going to be different for every woman. The best you can do is throw it out there in a way that isn’t pushy once you’ve chatted a bit back & forth. 

“I’d love to get to know you better in real time. How about grabbing coffee together or having a virtual movie night?” Putting both options out there allows them to decide if they feel comfortable enough to meet in person or if they’d rather chat virtually more first without making you look strictly low effort."
t3_r5ujxj,1,"I don't why people think a virtual date is boring. You don't have to do an activity to have fun. If you can't enjoy each other's conversation than it's probably not going to work. A virtual date isn't any different than a phone call except more interactive and great to see what someone looks like in person. 

I do these all the time prior to a real date to see if there is a connection. Saves time and money from going on a real date to find out if you are a good fit or not."
t3_r5ujxj,1,Not weird at all its natural too me some may be shy I normally try too get too know my clients a tad bit thru pics & conversation prior before.

Just a couple ideas. Have fun on your date!"
t3_pdir9l,11,"Oh man, lots of people against virtual dates here! 

Virtual dates were really common where I live during the pandemic. I’m a woman, and men suggested it to me and vice versa.

Anyway, tips:

* Treat it like a real date by looking presentable. Not need to dress up, but look clean at least. I had a guy FaceTime me in what looked like his PJs, and I was not impressed.
* Don’t just sit in front of the camera. Move around! Don’t make this feel like a Zoom meeting.
* Consider a show and tell of something you like (such as a hobby or your kitchen if you like to cook).
* Suggest grabbing a glass of wine. Some people like this idea, some don’t. You do you.
* Ask questions like you would in an in-person date. Most likely, she’s just trying to see if you vibe and have similar senses of humor. She may also want to see if you look like your photos and whether she likes the sound of your voice. (You get to assess the same things of course.) If you click, you click. If not, no biggie. 
 
Have fun!"
t3_pdir9l,6,"Thanks everyone! We had a nice 2 hour+  chat with  drinks and some good riveting convo and we got along real well. Her mom is a lung cancer patient so virtual dating is pretty important, especially right now but she was open to meeting for in person soon. Was certainly tough trying to organically progress conversation on a virtual date but so far so good"
t3_pdir9l,3,Hell. I did a PowerPoint on one of these.
t3_pdir9l,3,Play a game Don’t expect a long virtual date.
t3_pdir9l,8,Wow this sounds horrible….🤦🏽‍♂️
t3_pdir9l,-4,"Virtual dating? I think the pandemic really set the bar low lmao. Along with the “want to go for a walk” 

If would immediately see you as a friend lol

Iono a virtual date just seem like a zoom call. Too formal. My FaceTime calls with my friends are usually me laying down lol! A virtual date just sounds terrible."
t3_pdir9l,1,"You’ll do fine! Just try to make her laugh, she’s probably just as uncomfy/nervous as you are. The recommendation about the drink is great! Maybe just acknowledge the awkwardness to address it so it’s easier to overcome? I’d go with something like “sorry, somehow I’m more nervous having a virtual date than one in person so you’ll have to forgive me if I’m awkward! *laugh*”"

Since being out of diapers, she has never torn off her clothes in public. Full disclosure: She is occasionally selfish. Sometimes she forgets her manners and is disrespectful. Once in a while, she attempts to blame her brother rather than take responsibility for her own actions. When she behaves this way, there are consequences. No one coddles her or enables her. Perhaps this is why these things happen so rarely. She is eight years old. See where I’m going here?"

t3_rp99wt,1,How old are you?
t3_p2p58d,8,"I consider a virtual date a waste of time. You can’t really read Body language or get a real sense of chemistry unless both people have perfect lighting to actually represent who they are. I consider it a pointless qualifier. If I’m attractive enough to swipe on, and not an ass in messages, I’m attractive enough to get a coffee with."
t3_p2p58d,3,How about a video call? You can still gauge connection and it’s less pressure than a virtual date.
t3_p2p58d,5,"As someone whose hair alone takes an hour plus to tame, YES. Particularly partial to being able to go audio-only so I don't have to worry about spending any time getting ready. Once we're past the first date filter, a video virtual date is nice before investing in an in person date."

t3_p2p58d,1,"I like to video chat, but find a lot of men do not. Many won't even do calls. So I just don't date because I would rather not put in all the time and effort getting ready for someone who can't do a small courtesy to make me comfortable."
t3_p2p58d,1,"I had one the other day per the girl’s request with covid cases rising. Can’t blame them for that. 

Personally, I’m not a fan as I don’t like holding my phone communicate with someone. Yes I know I can set it down. But on the other hand, you can see if a person truly looks like their pics or not. Unfortunately this person deceived me that way. She was nice but I had no physical attraction and her photos were all old or at angles. I’m not saying appearance is everything but you can’t help but fee frustrated when someone does that, regardless of gender."
t3_pa9i4a,13,">he sent me a message saying we didn’t have chemistry... “What did I do wrong?”

You didn't do anything ""wrong,"" but it could be: your posture, your voice, your mannerisms, your pictures are taken from flattering angles and you don't look like that in real life. Sometimes it's something said in the conversation itself, but it's rare for me to weed people out just based on that.

There's nothing you can do (besides check with your male friends to make sure your profile photos are accurate). You won't get an honest answer from him about which thing it was. Just move on to the next!"
t3_pa9i4a,7,"""Chemistry"" for me is best assessed in person not via text or video. That being said, many seek something called chemistry which is unrealistic and often results in a bad outcome as you mentioned in your final paragraph. But, that being said ""no chemistry"" is often a quick way to just say not interested for whatever reasons. For a video date, I would expect simply to have a good conversation and not expect some overwhelming feeling. I seek to get along with someone and enjoy the company and then I give things time to grow. Awkward pauses don't kill my attraction because that's completely normal. But again, many people have unrealistic expectations of how compatibility works. Let those people weed themselves out."
t3_pa9i4a,6,"I have never done video dates, so take this as pure speculation… maybe they’re judging chemistry by the physical appearance on the video chat + flow of the conversation + personality + presence or absence of banter + similar values and interests? I don’t know. 

I’m not sure if awkward silences would ruin the date for me. I guess it could depend on how many there were, how long they lasted? If we had nothing we could talk about, or if the person gave very short responses without explaining anything in detail every time, I could see that ruining it. But, if I liked the person, I would probably give them a second chance to see if that was a fluke or not."
t3_pa9i4a,7,"I've had video calls where I could tell that I wouldn't like the guy in person so it didn't make sense to meet up. It's nothing they did wrong. ""No chemistry"" is just an expression that means no interest in taking it further. There could be a million reasons. I understand it's upsetting for you but try to see the bright side. If he's not interested you didn't waste any more time on him. On to the next one!"
t3_pa9i4a,5,"For me, a flowing conversation, marked by common interests and similar ways of thinking and acting, is the most important thing I’m looking for on a virtual date (or any date, really). So yeah, awkward pauses can definitely be a sign that conversational fluidity isn’t there with this person.

I’m also just generally good at keeping conversation going, and I can be interested in learning about someone even after I’ve determined we don’t have enough in common for me to pursue them, so a conversation that keeps going without long awkward silences isn’t necessarily an indication that I *am* feeling chemistry. Could be something similar happened with him. He noticed some things about you that don’t vibe with who he knows himself to be. It’s not a reflection on your worth at all.

I tried to write up some examples from my own life, but really it’s just something ineffable. With one guy I could put it down to him being more into finance and working out than I’m down for, but it was really a sense that our personalities didn’t vibe and I just wasn’t interested in him. With another it was how much traveling he did being incompatible with the lifestyle I want, but again it was really more that I just wasn’t feeling his personality as a good match for me. They were perfectly nice people in their own right.

Side note: what is with “smell” being such a recurring thing on this sub lately as a marker for compatibility? It strikes me as so random."
t3_pa9i4a,2,">How important is chemistry for you on a first date?

I have to at least be open to the idea of seeing her again. Occasionally I'll just know it won't work out and call it after one date. But usually it'll be either a ""Fuck Yes"" or ""Maybe Yes."" 

>And how do you gauge that on a virtual date where a lot of the intangibles (like how someone smells, for example) don't come into play?

I don't count virtual dates as proper dates. They're a good ice breaker and way to build rapport before meeting in person, but there's too many intangibles (or I suppose, literally, ""tangibles"") that virtual dates can't replace. Again, if they set such a terrible tone that I have no interest in meeting, I'll rule them out, but they can't get ""ruled in"" because of a virtual date.

> It made me wonder, “What did I do wrong?”

Probably nothing, he just wasn't feeling it. But I do remember having a phone chat with a woman who was (a) an hour late, (b) spent the whole time half talking to me, half puttering around her place trying to prepare for a party, and (c) complaining. It was very unattractive. So it's *possible* to do something wrong, but you have to do a **lot** for that to be the reason."
t3_pa9i4a,2,I agree with you that I am NOT concerned about instant attraction and instant chemistry on a first date or first meeting.  It does not tell you anything really.  I have more important qualities I seek in a partner.  I hate to generalize but I think men are much more fixated on instant chemistry.  I also think it’s more important for people who seek a hook up rather than a long term relationship.  That’s been my experience.  I think count your blessings that he showed his true colors so easily and so quickly.  I think you dodged a bullet there.
t3_pa9i4a,1,"I've been there. I got job interviewed a few months ago and she cut it short after 20 minutes! It felt brutal and efficient and not personal at all.  Ugh. I never want to do one again. What charms i have are much better displayed in person. 

The only thing i get out of a video date:

Can she hold a conversation? (Low bar yet so many can't clear it!)

Do i find her attractive?  Some people's photos don't represent the reality."
t3_pa9i4a,1,"I don’t think you can tell if you have chemistry via video, phone or texting but you can tell if you don’t have it if that makes sense."
t3_pa9i4a,1,"honestly despise video calls/phone dates EARLY on, even more so prior to chemistry being established.. the two I was coerced into taking this year were train wrecks and felt like a complete waste of time (believe both wouldve been fine if we had actually showed face)

understand it was a necessity when covid was going strong and meeting in person was far riskier, but doubt ill ever do another one.. feels like something I would do with friend/family to catchup rather then test the waters with a romantic interest \*shoulder shrug\*"
t3_u3v64y,1,wait what’s dovey?
t3_u3v64y,1,I have never thought of this but sounds like a good idea I'm interested to see if any one has any ideas
t3_u3v64y,1,"Hey there,

Been there myself. Have a look at the DateNight app and see if it helps 😊 [https://datenight.immersia.co.uk/](https://datenight.immersia.co.uk/)"
t3_qwk63b,67,"Finally, a useful guide. May I also suggest a scenic viewing at the upper floor of Wangshu Inn, a gentle hike across Qingce Village, and a visit to the Grand Narukami Shrine or Sangonomiya Shrine where the couple can pray for divine blessings together..."
t3_qwk63b,57,"wow, this is very useful! >!if i had a girlfriend in the first place!<"
t3_qwk63b,38,... this is very wholesome.
t3_qwk63b,86,"Childe mains are something else, I love 'em."
t3_qwk63b,23,Bold of you to assume that GI players have someone to go on dates
t3_qwk63b,24,[deleted]
t3_qwk63b,22,"Tart would low-key do this kind of guide, too."
t3_qwk63b,14,"This is so cute. 

I don't remember the exact spot but there's also a beautiful spot by Luhua pool where you can sit. I think you come across it when doing a world quest."
t3_qwk63b,13,So sad my fiancé quit the game so I’m alone… (virtually) lol
t3_qwk63b,30,You had my upvote from the moment you said Childe was going to be there. Mr. Worldwide supremacy
t3_qwk63b,7,Why is this so sweet yet it stings
t3_qwk63b,6,There is one beautiful spot in Liyue. When you follow the river inside the Mountain there is a water fall and a shrine for those keys. Downside is you have to kill Cryo Abyss Mage before you enter but it's very romantic
t3_qwk63b,18,This was very entertaining \^\_\_\^ thank you for making such an effort. These locations make for some beautiful screenshots. And extra brownie points for using Childe\~
t3_qwk63b,7,"Mt. Aozang is my favorite spot to be by far, but I also enjoy the tables near the story tellers in Liyue. I’m a big dinner theatre fan :)"
t3_qwk63b,4,"the pearl galley has a man who can tp you there, he stands by a small row boat and you'll find him near the kids playing pirate"
t3_qwk63b,5,…This is a pretty good idea for the LDR I’m in rn
t3_qwk63b,5,My ex actually recommended genshin to me but after a week of playing we broke up :DD
t3_qwk63b,5,"thank you op, time to take some beautiful pics of my characters!"
t3_qwk63b,5,Aww this is such a cute idea! All the spots are lovely! Though … I can’t help but see a series of pictures of Childe just being stood up by his date cause he’s all alone xD
t3_qwk63b,3,"Yes thank you I would like to go on a date with Childe in these places

(shaddup a simp can dream)"
t3_qwk63b,3,"Some of the most fun I had with my friend was just taking turns jumping. She started jumping a couple times so I jumped too, trying to do it halfway between her jumps. I don't know why she jumped in place originally but I thought I'd jump with her. She visibly hesitated in-game, then started jumping with me, and we were timing our jumps to take turns. For a bit we were on the same wavelength, and unprompted and without any communication except me seeing her character jump, we did a kind of jumping dance together."
t3_qwk63b,5,this is cute. now I wish I have a s/o who would play genshin with me
t3_qwk63b,6,Finally I can go on a date with Childe. Can't wait to pretend I'm with him while taking pics as him. Maybe I should bring my sister with her Childe along so I don't feel as lonely. Maybe I can use Zhongli =)

t3_qfq250,4,Hide n seek. Have the camera point to a room where your hiding and they guess exactly where your hiding and you do the same. Can be done with multiple rooms and is better with it
t3_qfq250,3,Play a game of chess together. That’s my go-to for both in person and virtual dates
t3_qfq250,3,"Charades. It could be movies or even stories about yourself.
You can make it, guess my favourite movie, favourite book, favourite moment when travelling, funniest moment during Chrstmas, worst birthday present you've received etc.

Pictionary can work too but with charades, you constantly see each other and I think that's what connects people."
t3_qfq250,2,Minecraft… at least that’s what I’ve done for dates lol
t3_p0cdft,1,Skribbl.io
t3_p0cdft,1,I love “would you rather” and “Family Feud” games. Those can be played virtually.
t3_p0cdft,1,"I'm a little late to the party, but truth or drink is also a good one!"
t3_p0cdft,0,Golf it can be hella fun !
t3_kueiin,25,"There's lots of articles and listicles around these days for games to play online. So if you search things like, ""games to play on zoom"" or ""games to play online with friends"" you should get lots of ideas! I also love the idea of watching a concert or something together online. Or maybe you could go to a museum together. Lots of museums have an online walk through or will have posted different exhibitions that you could go through together. Enjoy your date and have fun!!"
t3_kueiin,21,"-There’s Drawful! (Drawing charades) 

-Cooking lesson (make the same recipe so it feels like you’re eating the same thing together)

-Visit each other’s Animal Crossing islands, if you guys have it 

-Play an online escape room! 

-Virtual zoo tour! 


Good luck, and have fun! Maybe you guys will have fun just talking and you won’t need any planned activities."
t3_kueiin,8,"This sounds awesome.  :-)

I've been playing [off-brand Scattergories](https://swellgarfo.com/scattergories/) with my family, and we have a lot of fun.

Also, I'm a bit biased, but lots of public libraries are doing virtual events.  Some are lectures/author talks, a few are performances, but every now and then you might find something interesting.  Members in my consortium hold virtual crafting circles, meditation sessions, and I think one tried an ""open mic night"" (but that may have been pre-COVID).  Many of these may not lend themselves to a good date night, but it's worth a look.

And thanks to your question, I found that The London Library recorded an event discussing [women spies in WWII](https://www.londonlibrary.co.uk/whats-on/past-events), which looks pretty cool.

Have fun, whatever you end up doing!"
t3_kueiin,8,"You could also get one of those card decks that helps you get to know each other better. I bought the “We’re Not Really Strangers” deck at the beginning of the pandemic and it’s probably been my best investment for this time; I’ve used it to get to know both dates and friends better and it’s made one-on-one Zoom calls so interesting and satisfying. Here’s their website, and it also looks like Target and Urban Outfitters might sell it too. https://www.werenotreallystrangers.com 

They’re also on Insta and post a lot of their individual cards there so you can see their prompts: https://instagram.com/werenotreallystrangers?igshid=25jlwqb8sf2q

t3_kueiin,8,"Congratulations!! That’s so exciting! Think of simple games to play, like tic tac toe, hangman, or a drawing version of charades. You can draw on paper or on the computer."
t3_kueiin,6,"I had a great one last summer, we watched a spoken word poetry event for the first 45min and then chatted about that for 1 more hour."

t3_kueiin,2,There are alot of gaming apps that or a questions game. Think of things you want to ask? It can be daunting but if your well matched it can be a really fun thing. Had my first one during the 1st lockdown didn't go anywhere unfortunately but was a distance issue. Goodluck!!!
t3_kueiin,2,"https://en.boardgamearena.com is actually a great website for online board games. There are some games that are behind a paywall, but you can play certain games for free. Just need to make a free account."
t3_kueiin,2,"I followed along a Paint with Bob Ross episode with a date on zoom, it was fun and we both have a souvenir"
t3_kueiin,1,"From my experience a quiz game is fun! Think of a few topics each and ask each other multiple choice questions or something similarly easy about those chosen topics. Those could be virtually anything, starting with personal hobbies and interests and ending (after a glass of wine or two) with more intimete topics. Always fun for me!"
t3_kueiin,1,When I do online dates I usually play games like Minecraft and other easy games like that. Games where you can work together a little bit but also just have fun and do random stuff.
t3_kueiin,1,I’m a girl and wouldn’t like any games. I’d rather just talk.
t3_omwozx,10,Watch a movie/show with screen sharing
t3_qi1wvh,14,"Focus on yourself, and do something that brings you joy. Watch movies that he hates but you love, get busy finding your own lover on tinder, cook food you love that he hates, talk to friends that you haven't had time to catch up with (about anything but what your partner's doing), or craft something. 

Keep your mind busy so that you don't dwell, and by the time he's done, he'll be back showing his love for you and you'll realise it's really not a big deal. :)"
t3_hk1b6u,120,"Dude, heck yeah!!

Did you not wear pants like we suggested?"
t3_hk1b6u,60,"From me, about a month ago.... Might be an idea you can try:   


M58 - I ended a previous relationship at the beginning of the year. As luck would have it, I joined Bumble, and 1 other OLD app, about the 19th of March. A week later, the Ohio stay-at-home order was given.

Much to my surprise, I started chatting with someone right away. We carried on for a number of days through the app. Then I offered my phone number, with Gentleman’s promise not to call her or send any pictures, if we went to regular texting.

That worked and we had been texting for 2+ weeks before we talked on the phone. I asked her out on a Socially Distanced drive-by date.

We drove up next to each other, outside of Raising Cane‘s Chicken, and sorta met in person, kinda.... Each still in our cars.

I had her follow me through the drive-through, where of course I paid for her dinner, and told them at the windows that we were on a first virtual date! Lol

She then followed in her car, and we parked next to each other at a local park so we could just talk through our windows while we ate.

After a few more phone calls, & lots of texts over a few more days. we continued to get along great, so I asked her if she was comfortable Socially Un-distancing.... Maybe going and getting a cup of coffee (knowing she’s addicted to Tim Hortons by that point) and sitting in my car WITH me. She said Yes.   


Follow-up:  That didn't last as I hoped, but moving forward with OLD ....."

If they ask you a question or it makes for a good segue then you can tell your own stories. And don’t be a booze going unless he or she is boozin too."
t3_hk1b6u,4,"Be honest. Actually listen. Don't try to find reasons why you like her/why you get along. Don't be afraid to think 'you might NOT be right for each other'.

The other one was really nice. He seems like a really good person. Just lives like a hour and half away. I feel like that may damper hinge which sucks because I’m really picking up what he’s laying down. :)

Best of luck my dude!"
t3_hisdgk,37,"I'd suggest offering to buy her dinner before you start the virtual date to avoid any further awkwardness. Idk if she'd just give a random person her address on the spot, but thru text she can at least think about it"
t3_hisdgk,31,"If she has a favorite restaurant nearby, offer it this way: you call the restaurant directly! You'll give them a ring, put down your credit card info, and she can call in and order.

The restaurant gets to deliver themselves as opposed to Uber EATS/Grubhub/Caviar (saving them on $$$ and adding another good talking point that you're a socially conscious guy). And you avoid having to get her address and ordering for her (she gets control).

Moreover, you can ask the restaurant quietly to throw in an appetizer or a dessert or something as a surprise so that when she gets her meal, she has a little extra treat that you can take credit for.  :)."
t3_hisdgk,9,"Dress up in a dog suit similar to that worn by Jeff Daniels in the opening scene of Dumb and Dumber, works every time."

t3_hisdgk,2,"Super cute idea! I had a few virtual dates thus far and the ones I enjoyed the most were when we both “pretended” it was real and actually put effort into looking nice. Definitely make sure there is good enough lighting to see your face and the angle isn’t too awkward. Try to video call in an area that’s not too noisy as well. Other than that, it was usually the person and the conversation that really sold the “date” for me."

t3_msvbv2,3,"Portal 2 (download on steam). And video call at the same time as you play.

It’s a great two player co-op game, you really have to work together to get past each level.

Another game you can do together is minecraft, will work on ANY computer and you can build a house together.

Disney+ has the group watch feature, kinda fun with the emojis."
t3_msvbv2,1,"This will sound dumb, but ever heard of PonyTown? I made a picnic surrounded by flowers in it and surprised my boyfriend with it. He hated the idea so much, but then we ended up enjoying it quite a bit"

t3_o2303w,2,"Teleparty and Disney+ make for good movie nights! (You can also recommend each other snacks of choice to try and get closer by eating some of each other’s favorite foods)

Some games can work long distance well- battleship, for example, if you both have it

Go on a virtual picnic- just get outside (even in a backyard) and chat with each other (portable charger recommended)

Crafts can be another thing I can think of

Baking could also be fun!

(Hope you enjoy the suggestions- I should use some of these myself—)"
t3_o2303w,1,If you’re looking for text you could tell each other stories or try and write haikus together
t3_o2303w,1,"I’ve been on a picnic date! But basically just going outside in my garden while they were also outside on my phone (video call). And for getting on a deeper connection level with your SO, you can probably play we’re not really strangers online if you haven’t already. It’s pretty fun :)"
t3_o22mah,9,"A world I kind of fell into during lockdown is excel templates. Firstly excel is fucking incredible. Its not just a place to store numbers, it can be programed to do some cool shit and they can be downloaded easily. 

My favourite is a family fortune/fued template where you can fill in the answers beforehand (get them online) and play the game but people have made templates for lots of game shows"

t3_o1cjtx,3,"Well you could like write down notes and glance at them if you run out of things for talk about, she won't see anything. Try to keep it short, virtual dates should be like 30mins to 1hr. 

Probably also good to chat with friends earlier in the day to be ready and have a lot of energy on the date.

I think the latency makes thing awful personally but good luck."
t3_o1cjtx,3,"You could play a game together. There are a bunch of free ones online, and doing an activity will help you relax and have fun"
t3_o1cjtx,2,"Maybe you could play one of those ""50 first questions"" kinda games. Those always spark conversation and if it's still awkward with that then I guess you aren't a good match. After a few questions, conversation should come naturally"
t3_o1cjtx,1,"Don't force it, either the chemistry is there or its not. Awkward silences will rarely happen with a good match"
t3_o1cjtx,1,Be yourself always
t3_hh7j2g,80,"Ok I wanna share mine, my bf I went on a virtual date in April, I was in my pajamas(cute one) and he was there wearing nice black shirt and pants even shoes,  I was awestruck so I said give me 5 mins and I wore a dress and nice earrings and some lipstick. 
That day I know how adorable he is"
t3_hh7j2g,8,He’s a keeper:’)
t3_hh7j2g,9,My bf and I have a movie date once a week~
t3_hh7j2g,18,Thats...  Freakin...  Adorable!
t3_hh7j2g,5,That's just so cute. :3 ♥️
t3_hh7j2g,4,"AWWW, that’s so sweet 💖💖"
t3_hh7j2g,3,So nice of him (and you) to continue to see the beauty of long distance relationships. You keep it fresh. I do hope you all will be able to see each other sooner rather than later.
t3_hh7j2g,2,"My boyfriend and I try to do this! What we miss the most is just going to have a drink together at our favorite bar. Supplementing it by having a drink over zoom...but with the time difference it means one of us will have to drink in the early morning. Usually me, since it’s an excuse to have mimosas even though I’m technically alone"
t3_hh7j2g,1,Doing this for our 2-year anniversary this week!
t3_hh7j2g,1,"So sweet! Me and my boyfriend are planning to have a date tonight! We've both been working a lot and haven't had much time together, and even when we have, we've been sleeping because we're both so tired. But tonight after work we're going to get dinner, eat it together on call, and then watch a movie together. I think we might also make pillow forts too!"
t3_hh7j2g,1,"We had a pizza date the other night and made pizza together, we cooked it and ate it. It was so much fun ❤️"
t3_kd83o7,26,Any coop game should work nice
t3_kd83o7,11,"I have steam on my laptop, but i have easy games cause my laptop can't handle games well. But Flash games online will work. Do you, by chance, happen to know any??"
t3_kd83o7,11,"While I haven’t gone on a virtual date myself I feel like watching a movie night be a bit much on a first date when it’s done virtually. It’s a lot harder telling exactly how someone is feeling over the phone/camera which will most likely result in not many comments being made during that time, and in that case I feel like it might be more worth it to focus on the other activities that you mentioned in your post. You get to know the other person a bit better by doing that and there’s a smaller chance of awkward silence happening so it should be a win win.
Good luck with the date btw!"
t3_kd83o7,2,"If you’ve gone out with this person before, it should go pretty smooth, my girlfriend and I have had a couple virtual effectively-dates just calling for an evening to hang out. I’d recommend something where you’re meant to be talking more than a movie at least for a good portion of the date, because otherwise things can get awkwardly stale. 

If this is a first date in general, I think things will be a bit clunky anyways, so you’ve just got to be adaptable and hope for the best, but your plan seems pretty solid"
t3_kd83o7,1,"My partner and I started off with virtual dates back in the summer and we just would have a few drinks each and chat to get to know each other. Little bit awkward at first because it’s different but you get used to it and it feels pretty normal pretty quick! We used to play among us together on our phones, pictionary using the whiteboard feature or geoguessr (having to work out together where in the world google maps had dropped us, it has a website!)! Hope your date goes well!"
t3_tqfrqw,3,"I think a couple of them partner with some apps. The rare times I’ve done it have been through FaceTime or Google Meets, early in the pandemic. Usually a little activity planned like a game or something. They’re dreadfully awkward to me but nobody’s answered in an hour so I thought I’d throw my experience in."
t3_tqfrqw,1,"Not sure what you think is a great virtual dating option.  Tinder, Match, Hinge, and Bumble all have a video feature.  Text in advance to agree on a time is my only advice, otherwise you'll miss each other.  I haven't used the Tinder video. Bumble has a cute game feature.  The rest are basic, but staying on app is preferred by some.  

In my experience, a phone call or video call helps to rule out someone, but never shows chemistry.  I video'd a guy who was so boring I almost fell asleep.  Another obviously watched TV while talking to me.  Yet another drank so much during the video call that I'd call him an alcoholic."
t3_tqfrqw,1,"Sooo, I only meet guys I have video chatted with first. It has definitely weeded some guys out for me, and most guys have said they were happy we did it that way because when we did meet some of the initial awkwardness was no longer there. I usually have a glass of wine and we just talk. No games or activities planned. I prefer FaceTime, but I have a public IG account and have used that video chat when they don’t have an iPhone. I usually tell them I only have 30 mins, so I can get out if needed.  I’m not sure that is what you were really looking for, but this is my norm…"
t3_ghai5b,2,"Music festival. Put on your wellies, pour a drink into a paper cup and take turns in deciding “who” you are going to watch next on the main stage (YouTube your favourites playing live) 
Indoor tent set up again optional hehe"
t3_ghai5b,2,80s dance party! Get dressed up in your best 80s impressions and play your favorites.
t3_ghai5b,2,You should do an AirGuitar/lip synking battle!  Pick a bunch of songs and out fits for each and battle it out!

t3_ghai5b,2,"How about a Nailed It! competition. Choose a challenging baking project, craft, or home improvement task and both try to do it. See who nails it best."
t3_ghai5b,2,"Omg! I’m totally stealing some of your ideas. My bf and I are stuck in different continents right now and it looks like it might stay that way for months. We love having a movie night. Right now, we make list of movies we want to see and we take turns picking a movie or show to watch. We text each other during it and then video call each other afterwards to talk about the movie. It’s one of our favorite virtual date nights."
t3_ghai5b,2,"Have a Netflix party with the chrome extension! Bake cookies together over FaceTime :D Read each other stories at night! <3

Thanks for the opportunity friendo, i hope you guys manage to find some great ideas!"
t3_ghai5b,2,I am an online dominatrix. So I have to recommend role play. It’s fun. But it doesn’t have to be sexual if you don’t want it to be. I have all kinds of ideas if you want to send me a pm I could help.
t3_ghai5b,1,Bob Ross/ painting tutorial date! You can either find a video and get your own supplies or I think Painting with a Twist offers kits
t3_ghai5b,1,Write a story together. Whatever kind you like like sci-fi or it could be a cheesy romance. Each of you writing 1 or 2 sentences. Or a half sentence sounds really fun to me!
t3_ghai5b,1,Cooking class. You could find a recipe and a how-to video for a dish you both like and cook along with the video.
t3_ghai5b,1,"My immediate reaction was scavenger hunt! There are a lot of scavenger hunt contests on here, so it might be fun to make a list of items related to your relationship and have each other find things that fit! For example, if my item was “something that reminds me of our first date,” I’d run and grab a box of eggos because my bf and I ate waffles on our first date! Then you get to watch each other search and explain via video!"
t3_ghai5b,1,Dinner and a movie. Virtual tours of museums. You could do NSFW things via Skype. There are a bunch of games that have online/app versions. Virtual fashion show.
t3_ghai5b,1,"A journey through space. Read about temperatures, gravity and suchlike on each planet and spend a night ""travelling"" between them. 

Club Tropicana, 80s style, with appropriate clothing and music.

Move night. Start the same film at the same time and watch it ""together"".

Similar to movie night, but find a sport neither of you have seen before on YouTube, and try to figure out the rules together without reading anything about it."
t3_ghai5b,1,"Gaming! Play a game like stardew valley or something similar together! :D

Paint together it doesn't matter what and it doesn't matter if on paint or paper :D

Photoshop pictures of each other! (you can also use gimp or similar free platforms) :D

Have a wonderful date!"
t3_ghai5b,1,"Play a video game together: Lovers in a Dangerous Space Time, Monster Prom, Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, Stardew Valley, Don't Starve Together, Civilization, Overcooked, and Little Big Planet are some suggestions that my husband and I have enjoyed.

Have a double date!

My husband and I have an activity that we LOVE to do, where we share music with each other by sharing one song at a time and just listen together. He'll share a song, then I will, and so on. We introduce each other to new things, enjoy old classics together, and go down really fun rabbit holes. All our favorites we put on a playlist called ""Everything That Is Ours.""

Do a Show and Tell! Grab random or sentimental things around your homes and share them. Tell each other stories about where they came from and what they mean to you, or even show silly things! You'll get to know a lot about each other."
t3_ghai5b,1,Pictionary or trivia!
t3_ghai5b,1,[deleted]
t3_ghai5b,1,"I saw this idea online and loved it:

Break out your favorite day-trip snacks, and load up a [wildlife cam](https://www.cntraveler.com/story/these-wildlife-webcams-will-cure-your-cabin-fever) or virtual [zoo tour](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4JrYvfxstuXjsmR1pa9h8A).

Roam the woods with wolves in Minnesota or beat your chest among gorillas in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

My husband and I also love to watch the nature documentaries on Netflix and pretend we're there lol."
t3_ghai5b,1,"My husband and I have been married 21 years this month and we started out long distance. We did phone and email -- there wasn't much else available at the time, not even texting -- so that's what I mainly recommend. Maybe just a long phone conversation. Good luck!"
t3_ghai5b,1,find an online game like skribbl.io
t3_ghai5b,1,Have a dress-up party.
t3_ghai5b,1,80s prom!!!
t3_ghai5b,1,Superhero theme!
t3_ghai5b,1,"Some type of craft that can be done during FaceTime then be sent to each other. Thinking something like a DIY stuffed animal (similar to build a bear), stuffed pillow or wax hand kits?"
t3_ghai5b,1,movie marathon! find a good series that you both like!
t3_ghai5b,1,"Online games, like Cards Against Humanity and such?"
t3_ghai5b,1,Spa day?
t3_ghai5b,1,[removed]
t3_ghai5b,1,This is awesome to hear! Glad you are able to be so creative. What about playing charades together? Or watching and online concert together?
t3_ghai5b,1,Do a chopped themed competition and post final product in social media for people to vote on!
t3_ghai5b,1,Trivia night! you could play trivial pursuit or you can make your own questions and answers for each other! Thank you for the contest!
t3_ghai5b,1,What about a stargazing date? You can use the websites that have live feeds of different constellations and stuff. Or actually do it outdoors and see how it goes.
t3_ghai5b,1,I think each of you should ask each other questions (maybe make it a drinking game?).
t3_ghai5b,1,"Use your date to brainstorm 'Open When' packages..  what themes you would both use, what kind of things you would include, things that would make you smile etc. Then you can both use the brain storm to create a mini package to send. 

Eg. Open when you feel down or Open when you are sick.."
t3_ghai5b,1,"There are lots of big museums like Louvre that offer free virtual tours, or zoos :) I´ve recently seen belgium zoo where they put otters in the same area as orangutans, and they became friends :)  That´s also quite lovely to see! (just saw someone already suggested that, but i´m gonna second it!)

Also nice: Play games together! Something like Uno will still be playable with one set on each side :) 

Make a picture album of lovely memories. Those can be done online too, and can then be printed :) Our quarantine picture time! It usually takes quite a while to arrange them nicely, and you can write little comments and stories with them, taking turns. We have a picture album of our holidays together, each one with 1 picture and a recipe of the favourite food we found on that holiday. I am thinking about putting a ""corona time"" page in there, since holidays are cancelled for a while now...

Learn something together! Like basic coding, a language, an instrument? can be really simple and for lots of things there are easy tutorials. 

Maybe learn some sewing or stitching, you can even send each other your little gifts! (Also a lot of men think it´s too girly, but once they start get quite happy :D)"

You could also look into different co-op games."
t3_p08z8v,1,"Lots of games. Bloons TD6 is one I like. I'm also learning SC2 from someone I've been talking to. We also do blender graphics tutorials together? (though that's a very niche interest of his, that I'm also interested in.)"

t3_fow58o,67,I say treat it like you would any other date.
t3_fow58o,43,"Personally I’d put on makeup, do hair and pretty but not dressy clothes.  

Like no heels or low cut tops or anything ad think would look ridiculous sat in my house, but makeup hair etc to feel attractive and bring out best features."
t3_fow58o,19,"I'd still put on a nicer shirt, shower shave, and make sure my hair looks good. I may be wearing gym shorts below that, but that shouldn't show on camera."
t3_fow58o,19,"I have one on Friday night and though I joke it's a ""sweatpants only party"" for sure am wearing my CUTEST sweats and rocking my ""all natural"" (aka some makeup) look. 

Of course we should all love ourselves and think of ourselves as gorgeous without make-up and our third day wearing the same pj's - and we are no doubt! But given your post you might already have some hesitation - so get dolled up girl - not for him, but for you - if anything it will give yourself a boost of confidence to shine like the star you are!"
t3_fow58o,15,"I would at least go for your normal public look vs. quarantine look. Your personal style is part of the first impression you make on your date, even if it's video chat. I hardly wear any makeup and I'm not one to get very ""gussied up"" for a date under any circumstances, but I still wouldn't just turn on my webcam looking like I look right now! (Actually, since I work from home all the time, hanging around in my pajamas and then cleaning up for a video call is pretty normal for me.)"
t3_fow58o,10,"I wouldn’t see why not, I mean you want to give off the best impression you can right? Besides having something to get dressed up for might help you take your mind off the Covid-19 situation.

As a man, having someone to shave for and put cologne on is one of the best parts of a new relationship.

Let us know how it goes!"
t3_fow58o,9,"I’d do the whole nine yards like I would for any in real life date. It gets you in the same type of mood if you’re wearing actual date clothes. No matter the medium, a first date is still a first date. Bring your best self because first impressions are still everything 🙂"
t3_fow58o,5,"make your face look good, IMO"
t3_fow58o,5,"I've done video calls for a while, actually. Rather than exchanging endless messages, it's so efficient to spend 20 minutes on a call so we can both decide whether it's worth meeting for coffee.

Anyway: video call resolution is not good! Make your hair and skin look roughly normal, but eye makeup is wasted on this medium. 

INSTEAD: pay attention to lighting, angle and background. Take some practice videos."
t3_fow58o,4,"It's about confidence. What do you need to do to feel confident and most like yourself? 
If that's nothing, then fine. If that's a change of outfit, doing hair, or a little makeup, that's also fine."
t3_fow58o,3,You don’t need to go all out but sure you should put some effort into looking nice on any date.
t3_fow58o,3,"I’d never do it, but if I did, I’d get dressed up.

If this is the new dating for the foreseeable future, my dating life will be at a total standstill for a long time :("
t3_fow58o,3,Yes! What else do you have to do anyway? Might as well feel a bit of normalcy and get ready.
t3_fow58o,3,"I feel like getting dressed up always just helps my mindset so I feel more confident. When I was dating I had a rule to either have a phone call or FaceTime with the guy before meeting up and one guy I FaceTimed with literally called me as soon as he woke up so he was in a robe, in bed, with bed head—it was definitely a turn off and not the greatest first impression."
t3_fow58o,3,I think it’s okay to get dolled up! Have fun!
t3_fow58o,3,"I went on my first virtual date this weekend. I did my hair, put on a little bit of makeup, wore a cute sweater, but kept my sweats on haha. No chemistry between us, but it was a fun experience!"
t3_fow58o,2,If it makes you feel amazing dress up!
t3_fow58o,2,treat it like a skype interview. only the top matters
t3_fow58o,2,"Middle ground! 

Natural makeup, but maybe a touch heavier on the eyes because that translates well and doesn't look overdone on camera. 

Not-trying hard clothes. For me that's ripped jeans or cameo pants and a tank top with a zip-up hoodie thrown on top. 

Trying to nail that I'm-lounging-at-home-and-just-happen-to-look-fabulous aesthetic."
t3_fow58o,2,"I realized how much I didn’t want to date when the option of a virtual date presented itself and the last thing I wanted to do was put on my face, do my hair, and put on a nice shirt.

If you’re in it and want to meet this guy, I say go for it! At least put in the effort to look like your usual self.

If you’re like me and you’d rather show up no make up, bun head hair, tank top and sweatpants- probably a good time to take a step back from dating (in general not just online)."
t3_fow58o,2,"God damn these cat fishes! I'm glad I'm not the only victim. Yeah, I agree with video chatting early. It's now my policy."
t3_fow58o,2,"Yea girl, get all gussied up! I mean obviously not like you're going out to a fine dining date or out to a club, but do your hair, put on some makeup, and a cute top & jeans/pants..it'll boost your confidence too. My birthday was last Sunday and even though I was only going to my bf's apartment for him to cook me dinner, I still curled my hair and put on some eyeliner. It was nice to feel a bit of normalcy :)"
t3_fow58o,2,[deleted]
t3_fow58o,1,I'd not wear the sweatpants and I'd do my hair and makeup. I have webex interviews and wear a suit jacket for those. I want to somewhat impress in each scenario.
t3_fow58o,1,What do you mean “gussied up”?
t3_fow58o,1,"On my first skype date with my girlfriend, i wore a button up shirt, my favorite tie, and my favorite western leather vest. She had nothing but compliments for me. I send her selfies in my dirty work clothes and she still thinks I'm handsome. What I'm saying, is that if they like you, it won't matter what you wear on a virtual date. I suggest you wear, what they make you feel like wearing."
t3_fow58o,1,"Agreed! I would love to get dressed up and go on a date right now. Get dolled up - not over the top, and make the most of it 🤗"
t3_fow58o,1,This is absolutely rediculous.
t3_fow58o,1,"Blah - sorry for the catfish

As for the effort, I have a heap of work video conferences and put the same effort into my appearance that I would for normal work - but only from the desk up, sweat pants and slippers on the bottom, work blouse, light makeup and done hair on the top. Id do the same for a virtual date."
t3_fow58o,1,"I’ve done a few of these and totally Donald Ducked it. Great shirt, shaved, showered, etc... to look good, but didn’t even bother putting pants on."
t3_fow58o,1,this new trend is going to lead to an upheaval of the sexual harassment/assault criminal code
t3_fow58o,1,I'd say yes :)
t3_fow58o,1,treat it like a date. its a date. you still have to get in your work out clothes to virtually work out.
t3_fow58o,1,">Rocking sweatpants and not our best hair styles

That’s my fetish"
t3_fow58o,-1,This is actually a thing? Sounds weird. I don’t even like to talk on the phone.
t3_jmy97u,8,"Truth or Drink could work pretty well online.

t3_jmy97u,5,You can have a drinking game involving the game battleship
t3_jmy97u,3,"Play jackbox together or with friends. Cheap, insanely fun, and can be played sober or mix in some drinking easily"

t3_mq53tb,4,You're in your late 20s and you can't just have a conversation with your parents about it?
t3_mq53tb,1,"A nice café should suffice. It’s neutral and very unlikely to raise any red flags. Also, it’s becoming more normal for adults in their 20’s, even late 20’s, to reside with their parents. Times are much different than they used to be."
t3_mq53tb,1,Do you have a headset you can use? Dude be creative if I lived in a single room house in some third world country I’d be on the roof to get away from my family man get creative!
t3_mq53tb,1,Bathroom
t3_lfop5h,7,Check out [Caputos Online Classes](https://caputos.com/classes-and-events/)! There are some classes right after Valentine’s Day if you can wait for a belated celebration. A few years ago I attended a live chocolate tasting class and many of my friends love their online class format.
t3_lfop5h,3,I think a friend mentioned a chocolate store in Provo was doing remote chocolate and wine pairing. You pick up the items before hand then the store virtually walks you through the flavors and things.
t3_lfop5h,6,Search painting lessons on you tube and you’ll find many. You’ll just need to go to a crafts store and get the supplies.
t3_lfop5h,3,"Not exactly what you're looking for but theres a YouTube channel called Townsend: https://youtube.com/user/jastownsendandson

Its 18th century cooking. Last year for valentine's day, my husband and I cooked one of their recipes together, listened to 18th century music, and had a themed at home date :)"
t3_lfop5h,2,"Kevin Gillespie (Atlanta, Georgia restauranteur and Top Chef contestant) is doing a Zoom cooking class on Valentine’s Day for $50. You can just watch or cook along with him. It looks really fun. I’m planning on doing the Tiki Bar one on the 28th."
t3_lfop5h,2,[deleted]
t3_lfop5h,1,"Look on KSL and get yourself a massage table. There are tutorials online that instruct while your partner is on the table. 

You’ll thank me later!"
t3_kbdx59,8,"If you both have Discord, then you could screen share and watch films/shows together without the drama of syncing stuff up. For the most old school of you, you could even do some online crosswords/puzzles. I used to do that with some friends when we'd get bored and weren't in the mood for playing any games or watching anything. I'd load up one of the local newspaper websites, and hit up their daily crossword, we'd try to solve as much of it together over a voice chat as we could.

I assume a lot of museums have set up virtual website tours you could do as well, so one of you could share the screen and you could take the tour together, like a real date. Maybe you could set up an ingredient list for a dish one of you really loves cooking, and you could both cook it together over a video chat, ending with you both eating the same (or at least similar!) dish at the end. Something like that would be a great way to share some memories with each other, or something that one of you is really passionate about."
t3_kbdx59,10,Y’all could play 20 questions.
t3_kbdx59,3,"I’d recommend VRChat, its a pretty open ended place and game so the both of you can go to any place and just talk"
t3_kbdx59,7,"I know there are card games out there specifically for that purpose. Google dating card games and you'll find plenty :). 

Something original I know people did (but it's not really a first date kind of thing to do) is you order each other's meal to be delivered, through an app. They order for you and you order for them. I thought it was original and cute. 

I guess playing online games is also a possibility, i'm thinking things like cards or board games, but online! Something light and fun :)!"
t3_kbdx59,2,[deleted]
t3_kbdx59,2,">or talking while we’re simultaneously making dinner

I've been making this the core, actually. Figure out something you'd both enjoy and have a cookoff, it's a pretty great activity to wrap the conversation around and break the ice. Then have a card game and/or movie like others are suggesting."

t3_s3g46w,2,Nooo this scares me. Trying to talk to people and connect on zoom is hard enough. It’s makes me feel so anxious bc I’m just thsi screen and this other person is just on this screen and I can’t exist in my body in the same space. It just doesn’t feel right in my opinion. Like I want to feel grounded in my body and reality and on this earth! Not distantly connected via computer screen.
t3_s3g46w,1,[deleted]
t3_s3g46w,1,"Well it means less IRL connection. Do you think thats good for humans or not? We've evolved to crave company. They put people in solitary confinement because its one of the things that makes people lose their mind. Obviously, human to human interaction is still biologically necessary for us.

Over time, this may change. But then we'll probably change physically as well. If we spend all of our time in a simulation/metaverse, then what happens to our biological health? Is sitting all day healthy for us? Do you get the same satisfaction from metaverse love vs. IRL love? It'll be interesting to see the initial human guinea pig test results."
t3_fof055,38,Just make sure to virtually kiss her once it’s over.
t3_fof055,37,Ask each other Hinge prompt questions as ice breakers if it gets awkward. good luck mate
t3_fof055,12,Had a few FaceTime “dates” these past few weeks. Usually have a glass or two of win e. It’s fun and nice but I think this Covid business is so long term that it’s going to be really difficult to keep the relationships alive without some physical contact. I’m in NYC and any contact is just not a good idea. At this point I’ve paused my Hinge account and going to just wait it out
t3_fof055,26,"I had two phone call dates earlier this month and was messaging them a few days before. We talked about topics we were discussing over text and just expounded on that. I guess now we're in the midst of quarantine, you can ask them how's quarantine going for them/what have  they've been doing/etc. Treat it like a first date without physically seeing them lol."
t3_fof055,19,I had a FaceTime date last night that went for 4.5 hours. She had a couple cocktails while I had a few beers. It was really fun and I imagine we’ll do it again before long if this quarantine doesn’t let up.
t3_fof055,7,"Use your computer for the FaceTime. Generally I look much better on there than on my phone. This also allows you to be hands free. Pick a good location in your apartment with good lighting and nothing weird lying around to set up your device. Feel free to comment on her setting and show her yours (giggity). Really, you have an opportunity to show a girl how you live much earlier than normal and you should use that to your advantage. 

Also consider an activity like an online board game or a movie (if it's not a first date). Had a really good date that lasted about 4 hrs which started with a Netflix Party. You watch the movie together and can chat at the same time."
t3_fof055,5,Do a FaceTime and both have a drink during if you’re nervous. Set the phone down somewhere so you have your hands free.
t3_fof055,4,"Just talk to them like you would in person. If it’s hard for you to read signals and all that over a call, FaceTime."
t3_fof055,1,"Good lighting, a drink, and tidy location (kitchen, living room or dining room)?"
t3_fof055,1,"I've watched a movie together while we were on the phone. We didn't really watch most of the movie because we were talking but it gave the phone conversation more of a date feel. And it can lead to numerous different topics. Picking s movie we could both stream was fun. Then talking about different types of movies and actors was a good way to break the ice and easily get the conversation going. Good luck, I hope it goes well for you!"
t3_fof055,1,Gather your confidence and let it roll.
t3_fof055,1,Ask them what they're wearing.
t3_fof055,-3,Lmao no way I would do one of these
t3_fof055,-5,"Have a list of topics ready. That being said, I’m meeting a chick on Friday. If I get covid-19 I’ll take the hit and quarantine. It’s worth it. I’m also in a state with less cases"

t3_j056iv,7,What if you had uber eats or meal delivery to her house? Or flower delivery? That would make me feel special
t3_j056iv,5,"Oh love don’t overthink it and don’t try too hard. Just be you. Pay attention to your date and continue being honest about your feelings. After the date, ask her what would make a second date really special."

t3_ntboy0,1,Watching a movie together on zoom in dim lighting & in bed works as a middle step.
t3_ntboy0,1,You can't
t3_ntboy0,1,There isnt much that you can do other than verbally. I wouldn't recommend escalating your relationship in *that* way but sometimes silence does wonders. Lay in bed with maybe some low light and it being later in the night and you'll maybe begin to get the feels.
t3_ixbyri,12,Maybe a picnic? Like both of u ft outside on a little blanket and eat together? Idk how the service would work but i feel like that’d be super cute :(
t3_ixbyri,9,"My boo and I do movie dates. Where we will watch the same movie at the same time (netflix, hulu, d+, ect) while on call so it feels like we're together."
t3_ixbyri,7,"Read each other chapter books so that you can schedule story dates. Play board games like chess or battleship that you could manage to play from a distance. Co-op video games are really fun—a Minecraft realm between just the two of you is a really nice way to get creative and have fun and spend time together while feeling a little closer, since you can “physically” interact with eachother in-game! My bf and I also play steam co-op games sometimes. Cook together/eat together. Send each other letters/care packages and then make a date out of opening them when they arrive. Cuddle dates are really nice... just curl up in bed or on the couch with your device, wrap up in blankets, maybe get a snack, and hug your “partner” aka a pillow as a replacement, and just talk by candlelight or something. It could never be the same as real cuddling, but it helps ease the need for physical warmth a bit 🙃 Idk there’s definitely more out there but those have been some of our regular ldr dates over the past couple years"
t3_ixbyri,3,"Try rabbit! rabb.it I believe. You can watch movies together on the same screen and it’s legit, and you don’t have to talk on the phone in order to watch the same movie, just be on tab.it so you can FaceTime and watch a movie together on the same application! It’s a website and they have an app for mobile phones too :) Good luck! Also you could try both FaceTimeing or Skyping or zooming and making the same recipe for dinner together and see how each person’s turns out and maybe even plan to make it together when you see each other next! Or you can read to one another the same book and take turns, and read together and talk about it. Or start a book together and decide to talk about it once a week or however often like a book club just between the two of you! Something like that :) I’ll one back and comment again if I think of any more! Good luck xo"
t3_ixbyri,2,"Hahaha that’s so cute 😊 
You guys know what works for you I guess?"
t3_ixbyri,1,"Me and my SO like to do house chores together! Not really a date, but we will both clean, do laundry, etc. And doing it together makes it way more fun!"
t3_ixbyri,1,"Hey there! I actually just built an iOS app that's only open to a small group right now for testing, and it has open-ended questions and date ideas (some remote friendly!) for couples. When I interviewed LDR couples, I heard some really creative ideas like doing a virtual wine tasting, virtual puzzle or scrabble game together, mailing each other something that smells like you, giving your partner a virtual city/town tour of where you live, etc. You ""unlock"" these ideas through questions, some silly, others more deep.

t3_sojlkr,7,So your company assigned it to you....and you're assigning it to us? Let me send you my mailing address for a paycheque first...
t3_sojlkr,5,You ever see Squid Game? That's got a few good ideas.
t3_sojlkr,1,I could tell you some stories
t3_i3dvyh,9,Maybe he is just more concerned about Covid or has a pre existing condition? Or he still sees his mom or something?
t3_i3dvyh,6,"I am in Melbourne, Australia where we are taking COVID19 pretty seriously. Currently in a tight lockdown  and I have definitely done virtual dates. Usually FaceTime chats. But you can also do Netflix cowatching. 

Is it as good as a real date? No! But you get to know the other person better. And it is the responsible thing to do at the moment."
t3_i3dvyh,14,"imma play devils advocate here and say i’m kind of surprised people are so quickly assigning his behavior as “weird”. times are weird and confusing right now, everyone’s feeling lonely and in need of human connection. everyone’s also very overwhelmed with a lot of different information that seems to be updated hourly and those updates are looking pretty grim in a lot of places in the states rn. he works in healthcare so i could expect to see an added level of caution from him considering he’s probably more informed about the minutiae than most of us. it’s also bogus to expect people to just not socialize for all of 2020. healthcare workers need connection, too. one of the only ways to determine what distancing circumstances actually make you comfortable is by trying them out—it’s completely normal in the pandemic world we are living in for someone to be reevaluating their perceived safety constantly and walk back a decision they made after that re-evaluation. i wouldn’t take it personally considering the fear people have right now is very real. if his caution disinterests/worries you, you might not be a great match. also, you are trusting your clients to be telling you the truth about their exposure when the truth is many times we don’t know who has been exposed or not with absolute certainty until it’s “too late” and they’ve begun passing to others unknowingly. for that reason it’s completely acceptable for him not to want to put himself at risk by hanging out with you physically, knowing you don’t adhere to the mask mandate. 


have you suggested a socially distanced date? set up some blankets 6ft apart and have an outdoor picnic. he’s probably aware that the outdoors are the safest place to be right now so he might be more comfortable with an alternative like that."
t3_i3dvyh,5,"Get tested, show him the results and ask if you can come again or he can come over. Or just wait till the dust settles, at least he is taking the time to video chat and what not."
t3_i3dvyh,10,"HAVE YOU HEARD OF COVID?

Sure, he jumped the gun with a date, but he is taking precaution. If you want a guy who doesn't take precaution then go on Tinder.

Did you disclose your profession before you met?

There is [more to virtual dates](https://eddie-hernandez.com/virtual-dating-and-video-dates/) than eating."
t3_i3dvyh,2,Not really much different from having a long distance relationship. Lots of phone calls and video chats.
t3_i3dvyh,2,Its for sure strange. Then again you meet him on a dating site. So strange is expected. It could be anything from his GF is back in town to he lost interest to he actually did change his mind.
t3_i3dvyh,2,"Sounds like he got to see you and interact with you IRL, and didn't get strong enough feel. The attraction wasn't strong enough for him. You can go the route of pen pals, but it will get likely get less interesting for both of you."
t3_i3dvyh,2,No. Forget that guy lmao
t3_i3dvyh,1,"I mean, I’m all for letting people do what they want to do… but I think it’s odd he changed his mind.

I figure if a person is concerned enough about Covid to stop seeing someone physically, they wouldn’t even entertain the idea of seeing them in real life *at all* until the Covid worries are over.

I guess I would just feel like there’s more to the story for the quick turnaround. Yes, he could have just had a realization too. Everyone’s different. But I’m a skeptic and to me he’d be a stranger and I’d rather err on the side of caution."
t3_i3dvyh,1,"It's weird he said that after you met up ? 

I'd be pretty offended. Guys take a lit of chicken shit ways out of situations instead of just saying they're not that interested. I'd be sooo worried that he actually was just making up an excuse cause he doesnt really like me and would probably not bother trying to do anything virtually 

How are you going to handle it you think? How are you feeling? Did you like him ?"
t3_i3dvyh,1,"Once, maybe. If it doesn't turn into coffee I won't let it become a pattern.

Its just frustrating and pointless IMHO. You sit there staring at a screen trying to come up with things to say to be personable. Its all the worst qualities of an awkward date, a  staff meeting, and being stuck in an elevator with someone your recognize but whos name you do not know.  Once the ""new person"" novelty wears off there is little more to do to keep the fun going."
t3_lna223,4,havent you seen the show Gameboys? thats got a lot of virtual date scenes you can pick hahha
t3_lna223,2,i found that preparing conversation starters like small talks and tangent-ing off your mutual interests helps? :DD

t3_gen1qu,2,"I matched with a guy and he asked me by just being like “hey I want to take you on a virtual date, pick where to eat and I’ll order it” I liked the initiative"
t3_gen1qu,1,"jackbox party is a good one, more suitable for large groups of ppl tho"
t3_gen1qu,1,"Man - I'd be stuck. 

It seems like such a great way to beat boredom at both ends, but...

...yeah, I'd be out of ideas pretty fast on things that we could truly share unless I could e.g. send her stuff in advance, which obviously doesn't apply here. 

I'm fascinated to see what other guys say and what you end up doing / if it works out in any way, bookmarking this thread

EDIT 1 day later: My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined"
t3_gen1qu,1,"I've been thinking about this and what would you guys say to going through each other's tinder profiles, and I don't mean as some sort of shallow review that would help you after her, but going through each other's pictures and sharing what you liked/did not like as well as the person whose picture it is sharing the story behind the picture. Pictures almost always have good stories behind them and that could be one way to show genuine interest and get to know them better?"
t3_gen1qu,1,Netflix Party maybe?
t3_gen1qu,-6,"You shouldn't be having a virtual ""date"" with any new girls right now! Only ladies who should qualify for one are your wife or gf.  Understand these girl are just using these ""dates"" out of boredom, once things go back to normal all this time you invested will be for nothing. Unless you desperately need human contact I'd advise not to recruit new girls. I know this seems like the best time for online dating, but truthfully it's the worst! Well at least for the large majority(80%) of men.

What are you doing to do order uber eats for her and watch a movie? Maybe bother watch the same netflix movie at the same time lol. Op it's not worth having a virtual date."
t3_gen1qu,-6,"Just.fucking.don't. You must really not value tour time my guy. Why debase yourself to that shit when you could find some young hot tang "" ready to risk everything in the pandemic."" Seriously. There's babes breaking quentine orders everywhere."

t3_gy5n2h,18,Just have fun. Find out if your personalities mesh or clash. Do say or do anything that you aren’t ‘f *** yes ‘ about or would mind if it became a permanent thing. Dont put on w performance or say things he would wanna hear. Be yourself and remember to have fun
t3_gy5n2h,3,Capitalize on that. Make him send you a giftcard for food / send you postmates or waitr (food delivery apps) before you do that virtual date. He should be paying for your dinner or at least send you money for a bottle of wine. I went on a bunch and got a lot of giftcard and paypal for food. If he does then lot your date to an hour hour and a half tops. If the date is really bad/ inappropriate/ awkward and you want a way out say you need to get up and turn on the fan pr close a window. Get up so you're off camera and quickly shut that laptop screen and delete and block him.
t3_im2iw8,8,Netflix Party is so great.  My boyfriend and I also like to play virtual escape rooms that have become really popular since quarantine began.  We're both in college too so we also like to just have video call study dates.  Best of luck!
t3_im2iw8,7,Stardew Valley is an awesome date night game!
t3_im2iw8,6,"Watching movies via a voice call on a platform like Discord is something really nice. Video games like Minecraft and Stardew Valley are always great fun, too! Have a voice call going on as much as possible during these activities. If you're in very different physical environments, something like a video call tour of your surroundings or favourite locations can be very interesting!

Another idea is not a date, but to make weekly playlists for each other. About 5-6 songs per playlist is enough for a short and sweet little package to convey a mood of how you feel about each other the past week.

I wish you two the best of luck!!!"
t3_im2iw8,3,If one of you have a movie you want to watch you can use the screen share feature on zoom to watch a film together. My gf and I watched toy story 2 on our first zoom date.
t3_im2iw8,2,"you can play [skribbl.io](https://skribbl.io), uno, you could turn uno into strip uno if you have webcams lol.... 

idk what games you are into but my guy and I play a ton of call of duty, and watch netflix on the party app, we switch from kdramas to what he chooses lol and we have played Raft together."

t3_kj4zma,1,Plenty of fish on tinder I’d just move on.

t3_kj4zma,1,Have you ever tried Heartcade? I downloaded it recently after deleting Hinge. Its pretty interesting and I find people are way more responsive on there.
t3_kbjr8o,4,"What are you guys doing currently? When I do things with my bf, we mostly watch movies or tv shows or play games together. We have a huge arsenal of games and shows that we think of to play and watch together so we never run short of things to do. If I’m a little busy with something I watch him stream games that he’s playing as well, and vice versa. If you’re looking for alternative things to do, what I can suggest depending on your time difference is to do video call meals together if you can!"
t3_kbjr8o,5,"Currently long distance with my bf over break, we've started doing something where we'll use delivery apps to order each other dinner and/or dessert! It's a nice way to try new things and feels pretty thoughtful to pick stuff out. If that's at all viable for you I'd recommend it.

You mentioned that you play games but not what kind, so I'll just list what my bf and I usually play. Sometimes we play Starbound or Overwatch together, or one of us will screenshare a single player game. Usually something story-based and/or where we can talk about decisions together, like Mass Effect or Hypnospace Outlaw. Also, if you're familiar with Slay the Spire, my bf and I have started playing through the daily challenge at the same time while on discord call.

If you're not into video games, you can play MtG together for free via untap.in. Also (this one's listed in the resources for this subreddit but in case you haven't seen it) app.kosmi.io is great for just vibing out together. It has an MS paint emulator, virtual playing card/poker tables that are pretty easy to figure out, some other video game-y options, and you can also just web-browse together. My bf and I aren't super inclined toward *date* dates but we spend a lot of time going down youtube rabbit holes together, taking stupid personality quizzes, or streaming new albums we're excited about, etc.

Hopefully these suggestions help some! Wish I had more to list but like I said we aren't really the ""dating"" type lol. I might be able to recommend more specific game ideas if you have particular genres you like or whatever. Best of luck!!"
t3_kbjr8o,3,"Me and my SO have gone on walks together, like we'll facetime each other while at a park or something and just walk in nature and show each other the scenery and such. Real fun if you guys like nature like us. :)"
t3_kbjr8o,3,My partner and I pick a recipe every weekend and then cook and eat dinner together over zoom. Its been really fun and I'm becoming a better cook as we go!  Definitely recommend this as a date night for long distance couples :)
t3_jm8bvg,3,"Taking quizzes together, playing a game, movie night, do something creative (painting, drawing, write etc)"
t3_jm8bvg,2,"My boyfriend and I used to play LoL a lot, it's fun"

t3_gserfb,19,Minecraft? You could build a nice restaurant or just lay some carpet down for a picnic.
t3_gserfb,10,Portal 2
t3_gserfb,10,"play some League, it's not nice or fun for a date,but if he has anger issues you will notice


also you get to say you bottomed/topped him on the first day"
t3_gserfb,5,"Determine first if your date likes co-operative or competitive games. This could really make or break how much fun your date is having. If you guys are just starting to date, he most likely won't say unless you ask him.

Then, figure out your budgets. Are you both gamers? If so, find some games you might both own. If not, figure out free or cheap games you can play together.

The Epic Games Store has the Borderlands: The Handsome Collection for free right as of the day of this post. That's $80 of co-op looter-shooter, hours of game time at no cost.

If you like playing against each other, games like Magic the Gathering: Arena or Legends of Runeterra are fun competitive card games

There are tons of affordable or free games to try, just google ""best free games of 2020"" But it all comes down to what you enjoy playing together."
t3_gserfb,4,"Those ones that appear on the sidebar of porn sites, ""you won't last five minutes playing this game"" or something like that"
t3_gserfb,3,"Left 4 Dead

Nothing brings people together like running from zombies trying to tear you apart. It was what me and my husband did on our first date, been to ether for eight years"
t3_gserfb,2,"[Cards Against Humanity clone](https://pyx-1.pretendyoure.xyz/zy/game.jsp)

[Watch videos together online](https://twoseven.xyz/)"
t3_gserfb,1,"VRChat or FFXIV

I'd say PSO2 but that game is better for Weddings (even with FFXIV's elaborate virtual weddings)"
t3_gserfb,1,"Destiny 2
Super fun, free to play, and you can play together in a fireteam and work to complete quests or get rare exotic weapons"
t3_gserfb,1,"Overcooked 2, stardew valley, minecraft, and animal crossing."
t3_le3q1u,3,I’m interested in people’s suggestions too!
t3_le3q1u,3,"Discuss!  I don't want to share a special date like that but I might be up for a group date AND a special date.

She's not dating your bf right?  So a group date may be a bit much to expect so early with such inexperience.

You can watch the same movie together,.cook the same meal together, get a tarot reading together.

I am just sending cards, flowers, chocolates, balloons, muffins.  Normal romantic stuff since I can't do my normal trips and dinners."

t3_l3wn10,1,Maybe a quiz? Some of them are designed to make you feel closer to one another and they are really fun. You also won't run out of topics to talk about.
t3_l3wn10,1,Teleparty?
t3_ksahsy,4,I made a post about LDR activities [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/jvmvmg/ideas_for_longdistance_activities/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=sh) if it helps.
t3_ksahsy,1,"You could send him a recipe, cook it together on FaceTime and have a dinner date?"
t3_ksahsy,1,"You could use Netflixparty to watch Movies at the same time or if you both have the same board game at home, play that :)"
t3_ksahsy,1,"If you have a good data plan, being on call while out and about can be a fun experience.

Video games and movies are always good and easy. We share music and play a game together often.

Having a project to work on together can be satisfying.. for us it's work on a server/coding project, but whatever you overlap in that has a real goal so that you can work towards it together!"
t3_ksahsy,1,Ooooh! Order him and yourself food from y'alls favorite restaurant and eat together or watch a movie
t3_mxyrkr,5,I like watching terrible movies and texting!
t3_mxyrkr,3,"There are websites/apps where you can watch a movie together and video chat. 

You can also cook the same meal while you video chat. I’ve had a few “dinner parties” this way. It’s fun and having a shared activity keeps the conversation flowing. If you take turns picking recipes it makes things easier for future dates too.

My friends and I are in the same town, so we take turns dropping off ingredients for our chosen meal to doorsteps."
t3_jnle5x,5,"Keep in this mind, she’s gonna be just as nervous as you so don’t sweat it so much. Let the conversation flow naturally, show her your place maybe? And have her do the same. Play 20 questions. Conversation is the first step to worry about. She’s not going on a date with you to play games. That comes later. I’m really excited for the both of you! Good luck!"
t3_jnle5x,4,"This is adorable.

My LDR SO and I play a lot of chess... We also watch movies together, but I gotta say, regardless of the activity you choose, it's going to be awkward and uncomfortable and anxiety-ridden. I honestly don't think it matters how much experience you have in dating - on- or off-line - you're taking a risk by being vulnerable, exposing yourself, eliminating the ""time to think"" between text messages, and that would be nerve-wracking for anyone with a pulse. This will probably be your first \*real\* chance to decide if you're actually into this girl, and the same goes for her.

Fortunately, video chatting provides ample time to prepare, and it appears you're willing to make that effort. When the time comes, be honest about how you're feeling: that nervous/awkward moment can also be quite endearing - but (I believe) you must acknowledge it! Saying it out loud takes the power out of the emotion, and it offers the other person a chance to relate, or ease the tension by sharing their thoughts/feelings. It will open the conversation to create a communicative relationship between you two; a relationship rooted in honesty.

After you've both gotten past the giggly awkward moment, ask her if she likes to play games and see if she's into the idea. It's certainly not a bad way to start. You could also prepare a short list of questions to ask her that aren't considered ""small talk,"" if the game doesn't work out. 

By the way, this is just my personal opinion based on my experiences in a LDR where we met online - but don't ask her favorite color or band or something silly like that. Sure, those can be some fallbacks, but I don't believe that those kinds of questions create a comfortable space in an online setting; besides, you've probably already talked about it anyway. Instead, have thoughtful questions prepared that have to do with things she's already told you about. Make her feel important, and heard. Umm maybe something like, ""I remember you mentioned that you're taking this class, why did you choose it?"" or ""Where did you learn how to do \[so and so that you've told me about before?\]"" 

Man, I'm making that sound incredibly lame but I really think that if you have some in-depth questions on deck, it will start a genuine conversation that will (hopefully) get you both into a comfortable space, where you're both interested in Facetiming again.

Good luck! Hope it all works out in your favor."
t3_jnle5x,3,"My boyfriend and I play a lot of [webopoly.org](https://webopoly.org)! It's literally monopoly, just with major tech corporations. Battleship, virtual golf, etc are all good options too. If you're both willing to spend a bit, you can't go wrong with Minecraft. 

I was super nervous on my first virtual date too, especially hearing my s/o's voice for the first time but it was so much easier than I thought. You'll easily fall into conversation from ""wow, your voice is pretty great"". 

You've got this! Good luck."
t3_jp5lc9,1,There is a free online version of settlers of catan at colonist.io - fun turn based strategy game
t3_jp5lc9,1,Carcassonne is one of the rare games that works well with two players.
t3_jp5lc9,1,"Depends on her skill/interest in gaming, does  both of you have a console you guys could play online using? Some good games to play there, portal 2 co-op for PC is pretty fun (but thats paid), also has a bit of a learning curve if she hasnt really played video games. I feel team/co-op games are good though cause they let you work together and bond"
t3_jp5lc9,1,"Does it have to be a digital game? I'd keep it old school and play something like yahtzee. The shaking, tossing and sound of the dice would be way more interactive and fun than just tapping buttons on a screen in my opinion."

t3_n2u53r,1,Oh sending her postmates to her house is so romantic girls do love food! Y'all could have a virtual meal date
t3_itj9in,2,"> Fossils

Maybe The Natural Sciences Museum in Brussels? Holds a number of ur world-famous Iguanodon skeletons founds at Bernissart.

> Castles

Technically not a castle but visited the ruins of the Villers-la-Ville abbey recently, worth checking out. Cellphone reception/internet could be less than ideal though."
t3_itj9in,1,[deleted]
t3_itj9in,1,How about the Japanese garden near Hasselt?
t3_kxgq9r,3,"Order two pizzas. One to her house, one to yours. Then call her saying that you want to have a movie night while on FaceTime"
t3_kxgq9r,2,"Watch a movie together.  Hit play on your netflix or hulu or whatever at the same time, and stay on the phone while you watch"
t3_kxgq9r,1,Show up at her house
t3_kxgq9r,1,"Can you send her flowers or put together a care package that she “unboxes” during the date? That’d be super cute!

You may have done some of these ideas already but also:

- scavenger hunt (each put together a list for the other person, then you swap and have to go find it around the house together. Could be things like “blue article of clothing, Book title that starts with the letter “v”, etc)
- movie viewing party (take turns picking the movie)
- you each order the other a surprise dinner and then eat together
- 3 pictures - pick three photos that mean a lot to you and then tell each other the stories behind them
- 36 questions game (ask and answer the questions each, supposed to make you “fall in love”)"
t3_jv2n3m,5,"I had a WhatsApp date this weekend, and as far as the only video date ive done, it went well enough. Better than my friend group trying to do happy hour over video anyway. It certainly helps that we meet beforehand, and she had to cancel last minute because her coworker tested positive.
She wanted to do origami and I have a literal flock of origami chicken in my desks. I sent her the instruction for the chicken, and we talked while making chickens. Then she showed me her kitties."
t3_jv2n3m,3,You could swap favorite recipes and cook together. So she would cook the recipe you sent and vice versa while on zoom or something. Or you could both draw/paint/craft and show each other the results
t3_jv2n3m,1,Personally I think it’s just pointless either have a real date or do anything.

t3_gizmrj,3,"do it quick imo. I feel like the more you talk on the phone (texting), the less you get to know each other irl and the more awkward it can get. When i dont get asked out after more than a week i assume he just want to chat.. and i dont want to waste my time. Every girl is different obviously but the sooner the better :)"
t3_gizmrj,2,"I don’t think there is any perfect timeline. I’d base it off how well you two are interacting. Does she seem interested?

You could always go for it.. what’s the worst that could happen? She says no? Okay, so give her more time or cut your losses. :)"
t3_gizmrj,2,Just next time you are talking say “hey want to video chat?” or be like “hey looking forward to talking tonight want to video chat?”. The second option allows her to look her best and be ready if she’s into that. Don’t think too much about it. You don’t have to make it an Instagram worthy affair.
